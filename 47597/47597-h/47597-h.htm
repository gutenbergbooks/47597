<h2 class="p4">FOREWORD</h2>

<p class="p2">The Author desires to state that none of the characters
in this story, either boys or masters, are portraits.
The incidents are entirely fictitious, and Deal School,
though it shares certain topographical features with
the school with which the Author is connected, exists
only in his imagination.</p>

<p class="pc4 elarge">DEERING OF DEAL</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pch">DEAL SCHOOL</p>

<p>If one chanced to examine the catalogues of Kingsbridge
College for the past hundred years it would be
found that in most of them is recorded the name of
some dead and gone Deering&mdash;a name famous in the
annals of the South&mdash;who came up from Louisiana,
“marched through the four long happy years of college,”
as the old song has it, with an arts degree to his
credit; or, perchance, marched out at the end of one
or two of them with nothing to his credit at all.
Kingsbridge was a tradition in the Deering family,
southern though it was&mdash;a tradition that was hardly
broken, even when in 1861 Victor Deering and a hundred
other chivalrous youths threw their text-books
out of the windows and enlisted in the armies of the
Confederacy. Victor’s father, Basil, too, was in the
war, and laid down his arms at Appomattox as a
brigadier-general&mdash;brevetted for gallantry on the field
of action. For a while it seemed that no Deerings
would go to Kingsbridge, but time at length healed
the old antagonisms, and when it became a question
where young Anthony, Victor’s boy, should go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
college, there was no longer any question that Kingsbridge
should be the place.</p>

<p>Preparing for Kingsbridge, before the war, had
meant going first for three or four years to Deal School,
another Cæsarean seat of learning, almost as well
known as the college itself. The warm-hearted old
general had as fond memories of the school-topped,
wind-swept hill above the rocks of Deal, as he had of
the meadows and hills about Kingsbridge. There were
a great many family counsels held in the old house on
the bayou; some prejudices pocketed; some feminine
qualms appeased and tears dried; and a great deal of
correspondence was exchanged between the Head
Master of Deal and the old General, who ruled his
family to the third and fourth generation.</p>

<p>And so at length on a bright crisp September morning,
when he was about fifteen years old, Anthony
Deering found himself getting out of the little way-train
that runs from Coventry to Monday Port across
the Cæsarean flats, and enquiring diligently for a hack
to drive him out to Deal School. He had made the
journey up from New Orleans alone, without a quaver
until he came to his journey’s end. He was a day late
for the opening of school, so that he was the only
passenger to alight at Monday Port.</p>

<p>A vociferous cabman offered him the services of a
dilapidated fly and a bony horse. He looked about
for better, but not finding them, he pulled his belt a
trifle tighter, swallowed the lump in his throat, and
quieted the man by thrusting his bag into his hand.
Then he jumped into the crazy vehicle, and shouted in
a high voice, “Deal School!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Tony had never been to Monday Port before, but
he had heard a great deal of it from his mother, who
had spent gay summers there in her girlhood, before
the war. It had once been a favorite resort for
Southerners, but after their exodus, was taken up by
Northern people, and for a decade or so was one of the
most popular Cæsarean watering-places. The town
occupied a long stretch of level country between the
sea and a range of low-lying sandhills. Its streets
were pretty and clean, shaded for the most part by
maple trees, with modest cottages on either side,
and here and there more pretentious modern “villas,”
representing almost every conceivable style of architecture.
Tony was not much interested in Monday
Port, however, and he eyed these pleasant homes
with a rueful glance, which gave an odd expression to
his attractive young face; for despite the shadows
in his gray-blue eyes and the frown on his dark brows,
it was evident that he was anything but a surly or
fretful lad. There was a sparkle in the depths of the
shadow; lines of cheerfulness behind the frown; the
glow of health in his cheeks.</p>

<p>At last the old horse dragged the fly listlessly out
of the shady street and they came into an open space,
which fronted on a broad sheet of water flowing down
with a fine sweep to the sea. A long bridge led across
Deal Water to a straight white road which cleft a
clean path through the rising meadowland. Eastward
the wide expanse of green was edged by a line
of tawny sands, where the turf swept down to the
bluffs. Beyond lay the sea, sparkling like a great
splendid jewel. Tony loved the sea, and a thrill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
went through him as he saw it again now after a long
time. A load seemed lifted from his heart, though
there was still some wistfulness for the sleepy bayou
and the old plantation and the dear familiar faces.
He remembered how so many Deerings before him had
crossed that great still pond on their way to school,
and had known that restless sea during happy boyhood.</p>

<p>“Is that the school?” he cried to the driver, springing
up as he caught sight of a pile of buildings which
crowned a hill-top at the end of the long white road
ahead of them. There seemed to be a great many of
these buildings, standing shoulder to shoulder, long
and low for the most part, but one higher than the
rest, marked by a tapering spire. The rays of the
morning sun glinted on the windows so that they
seemed ablaze with light. A fresh breeze was blowing
off the ocean. There was the smell of seaweed in the
air and of herby autumnal flowers. Here and there
a field was stained literally purple with Michaelmas
daisies,&mdash;a vivid contrast to the deep green of the
meadows.</p>

<p>Tony could scarcely contain himself as the fly
crawled up the steep road. Then, just as they reached
the summit, a few paces before they turned into the
school drive, another splendid view opened to them
unexpectedly. On the other side of the school grounds
the hill descended much more precipitously toward
a point of rocky land which jutted into the sea; to
the east the land bent with an enormous curve, embracing
a wide beach about a mile in length; then,
turning sharply again, rose into hilly land, thickly
wooded, rocky-shored, which crowded about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
great inlet, somewhat misnamed the Strathsey River.
Across the morning haze gleamed the shores of a
broad peninsula known as Strathsey Neck. In the
midst of the river,&mdash;or bay, for it was really that,&mdash;a
pile of rocks jutted from the waters, on which was
situate a lighthouse, marked in the charts as Deigr
Light.</p>

<p>Tony was a little bewildered by the unexpected
impelling beauty of the situation. The cab turned
into the school driveway then, and at the end of a
graveled elm-shaded avenue, he saw a low long building
of gray stone&mdash;of Tudor architecture, he learned
afterwards&mdash;approached by a broad flight of stone
steps.</p>

<p>A maid-servant met him at the door, surmised that
he was the new boy, and said, “I will show you at
once to the Doctor’s study.” They passed through
a large hall, which Tony just could see was attractive,
with its black oak paneling and the great open fireplace
at the farther end, and then he was ushered into
a cheerful pleasant-looking room, his hand was
heartily clasped, and a gruff kindly voice bade him
welcome.</p>

<p>Tony looked up, and saw a pair of sharp blue eyes,
set deep under shaggy gray brows in a firm strongly-lined
face, under a mass of thick gray hair, looking
enquiringly into his. It was a kindly, inquisitive
glance, as though their owner were wondering what
manner of boy this was. Doctor Forester was growing
old now, but he was still in the prime of his activity
as a vigorous and effective head master. He looked
down upon the fair copper-colored head of the boy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and into his frank gray-blue eyes, which looked back
fearlessly.</p>

<p>“Ah, Deering, I am glad to see you. I am sorry
you are late, however, for it is not the best way to
begin,” he said, speaking with a sharp accent, and in
quick phrases, which Tony was to learn were characteristic.</p>

<p>“I know, sir, but my grandfather&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Your grandfather, my boy, used to get caned
once a week by old Doctor Harvey for the same incorrigible
offense. But I understand the situation.
You are not to blame. You are to have a room in
Standerland Hall and sit at Mr. Morris’s table in
the dining-room. Stop here a moment, while I send
for a boy to show you about. Then you can get
your books, and go into class the last morning period.
We are going to try you in the Third. The master-in-charge
will assign you a seat in the schoolroom.”
The doctor touched a bell on his desk. “Send Lawrence
to me, please,” he said to the servant who answered
it; and then turning to Deering again, “Well, my boy,
how is your grandfather? Has he told you that we
were at Kingsbridge together? He was a senior when
I was a freshman. He rescued me one night at a
hazing-bee. Those were good old days&mdash;never the
like of <i>them</i> again! I am glad they are sending you
north to school and college. Ah, Lawrence! come in,
come in. Lawrence, this is Anthony Deering. He is
to be in your form and hall. Take him about a bit&mdash;that’s
a good fellow&mdash;introduce him to the masters&mdash;and
report to Mr. Morris before the last period. Good-bye
now. Come to the Rectory to tea this afternoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Deering, and we can have some talk about the
General.”</p>

<p>The Doctor said all this very rapidly, and almost
before Deering and Lawrence had finished their
embarrassed greeting, he had turned to his desks and
was busy with his papers.</p>

<p>James Lawrence&mdash;or Jimmie, as he was always
called&mdash;was a slender, dark-haired handsome youth.
He had a frank countenance, an engaging smile,
black hair, and beautiful dark eyes. He recovered
his self-possession in a moment and looked Tony over
critically, as he waited for the Doctor to finish speaking.
“Very good, sir,” he said, at length. “Come
along, Deering, and I’ll show you where you are to
room.”</p>

<p>“You may think the old gentleman is in the clouds,”
he said, as they turned into a long corridor leading
from the Doctor’s study, “but we have to wake up
early in the morning to fool him&mdash;not that we don’t,
you know!&mdash;but he is keen enough to make it mighty
interesting. Why I have got twenty-five distinct
directions about you already. You are to sit next me
at table, for instance, and poor old Teddy Lansing
is transferred to Mr. Williams.”</p>

<p>“Will he mind?” asked Tony, a trifle anxiously.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll find out if he does mind. Teddy’s a
noisy brute. There! that’s the way into the schoolroom,”
he interrupted himself to say, “you’ll wish
you could forget it in a week or so. Take a tip, watch
Kit Wilson and me; we’ll show you a trick or two.
But you are so beastly new.... See that animated
broomstick toddling along? That’s old Roylston,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the Latin master; you’ll meet him too soon for your
comfort; we won’t stop now, despite the Doctor’s
instructions. Give him a wide berth, and don’t bluff
him.”</p>

<p>By this time they had got outside the Old School
on the terrace, with the wonderful outlook over bay
and sea. Tony began to make some remark about the
view.</p>

<p>“Oh, the view!” exclaimed Lawrence, “You’ll
get used to that too. That’s Lovel’s Woods over
yonder,” he said, pointing to a stretch of thickly-wooded
hilly land by the Strathsey shore, “rather
useful in the winter term. You’re in Standerland,
eh? That’s that long crazy gray stone building over
the quad. Lucky dog to get a room, say I. Bill
Morris is the master&mdash;a decent sort; an old boy,
strong therefore with the doctor. Thank heaven and
the Head that you’re going to be under Bill. No,
we aren’t going over there now. You’ll have to
scamper over there to wash up before dinner. I’ve
got a page of Cæsar to do before last period, so
let’s toddle to the schoolroom. Bill’s in charge, and
he’ll smooth things over. Wait for me after school
and I’ll pilot you in to grub.”</p>

<p>They had brought up now at the entrance to the
Schoolhouse, which was connected with the Old School
by a cloister and formed the north side of a great
quadrangle. To the west lay Standerland House and
the Chapel, a pure Gothic structure with a beautiful
tower and spire, and the Rectory, the Head Master’s
residence, between. Eastward lay the Gymnasium and
the Refectory or dining-hall, the latter on a line with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the Old School. North of the Schoolhouse was another
quadrangle, flanked by Standerland and the
Gymnasium, with Montrose and Howard Houses on
its northern side. Beyond that still lay the playing-fields.
All this Jimmie barely had time to indicate,
as the two boys ran up a wide flight of steps, traversed
a broad corridor, and entered the schoolroom, where
he introduced Tony to the master-in-charge.</p>

<p>Tony could never remember what was said by either
of them; he felt as if the gaze of the hundred pair
of eyes, belonging to the hundred boys bent over their
desks, was burning into his back. There was a vague
sort of comfort in the pleasant tones of Mr. Morris’s
voice, and somehow he came back to consciousness
a little later, and found himself seated at a desk,
with a brand new copy of the <i>Gallic Wars</i> open before
him, and his lips pronouncing over and over in a
meaningless sort of way&mdash;“<i>Gallia est omnis divisa
in partes tres</i>....”</p>

<p>Thus Deering’s school days at Deal began.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pch">A HAZING BEE</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Tony did not get over to Standerland
all that day. He had waited for Lawrence after
that first curious hour in the schoolroom and the subsequent
recitation in Cæsar with Mr. Gray, generally
known as “Pussie,” a clever, sarcastic young master, who
mercifully however paid him no attention. Instead
then of running over to the dormitory to wash up, Jimmie
led him down a flight of back stairs in the Schoolhouse,
and through a series of subterranean passages, to
a remote little room, in which stood a stationary washstand
in official disuse, which had probably been designed
for the use of the servants. This Jimmie announced
with pride to be his private luxury. “It saves
a deal of time and trouble to wash here,” he explained.
Tony could not see that it really did, but he felt at
once a boy’s pleasure in doing the irregular thing.</p>

<p>In this makeshift of a washroom they found another
boy, already washing his hands. He was a bright-eyed,
fair-headed, stockily-built youth, whose face
sparkled with good nature. “Hello, Jim,” he cried,
as they came up, “who is your new friend?”</p>

<p>“Deering was his father’s name,” Jimmie answered
facetiously, “Anthony was bestowed upon him by his
sponsors in baptism.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“So! Well, fellow Christian, where do you hail
from?”</p>

<p>“I?&mdash;I come from Louisiana.”</p>

<p>“Louisiana! that’s a heck of a way to come. Well,
Deering Anthony, lace my boots while I dry my hands.”</p>

<p>“Go to the deuce, Kit!” Lawrence broke in.
“Deering’s in the Third. Take your sloppy boots
to the First Form locker-rooms, and don’t brag here.
Swat him, Tony, if he gets fresh.”</p>

<p>Kit burst into a ripple of delicious, infectious
laughter. “Oh, that’s the ticket! Well, Tony, my
darling, will you condescend to dip your lily fingers
in this humble basin? The attar of roses unfortunately
is ‘all,’ as the excellent Ebenezer Roylston has been
known to put it. Permit me to offer you a towel.”
With the words he deftly extracted Jimmie’s handkerchief,
and thrust it at Deering. There was a laugh
and scuffle between the two boys, quickly over as a
distant bell sounded; they grabbed their coats, and
fled unwashed toward the great dining-hall, which
occupied the same relation to the Old School on the
east as the Chapel did on the west.</p>

<p>“Can you play football?” asked Kit, as they ran
along the terrace.</p>

<p>“I don’t know&mdash;” began Tony.</p>

<p>“Well, come out this afternoon, and find out.
Report to me in football togs at three, and I’ll give
you a chance on the Third Form squad.”</p>

<p>“Thanks awfully.”</p>

<p>“Cut that out! Scoot now after Jimmie, or you’ll
be late. Good-boy Bill hates a laggard, and you’re
at his table.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Then had come the first bewildering dinner, with
the myriads of strange faces about him. Already he
thought of Jimmie Lawrence, next whom he sat, as
an old friend. In the afternoon he was carried off
to the Store and fitted out with football clothes, and
then led off to the playing-field back of the quadrangle
to be tried out. The game was strange to him, and
he felt an awkward muff at it. But as a matter of
fact he was quick and fleet and intelligent, and at
the end of the afternoon, Kit deigned to pat him on
the shoulder and to bid him reappear on the morrow.
“You are not half bad, you know; for a land-lubber,
so to speak. Mind you’re regular, and don’t eat
toffy, and keep clear of the pie-house!”</p>

<p>At 5 o’clock Tony found himself excused from afternoon
school by the Doctor’s command, and went
in to tea at the Rectory and was introduced to Mrs. Forester&mdash;a
sweet, motherly, middle-aged woman; and
to two or three masters, the sarcastic Mr. Gray
amongst them; and to four or five members of the
noble Sixth, who were discussing the new football
material. Tony spent a pleasant half-hour there,
and after a talk with, or rather from, the Doctor about
Kingsbridge and Deal in the olden time, he was sent
back to the schoolroom and to afternoon recitations.</p>

<p>At 9 o’clock he was dismissed from evening school,
and the attentive Lawrence steered him over to
Standerland Hall, where Mr. Morris showed him the
rooms he was to share with a Fourth Former. This
was a pleasant little apartment, consisting of a study
and two bedrooms, which looked eastward, over
Lovel’s Woods and the Strathsey River.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“You can unpack to-morrow,” said Mr. Morris,
“but you may take half-an-hour now to get acquainted
with your room-mate.”</p>

<p>As they entered the room a tall, lanky youth had
arisen from a Morris chair. He had rather fair, well-moulded
features, a cool gray eye, a quiet but somewhat
patronizing manner, a drawl to his speech, and
a general air of distinction, not unmingled with conceit.</p>

<p>“This is Tony Deering, Carroll. Tony, allow me
to present you to your room-mate, Mr. Reginald Carter
Westover Carroll, of Virginia.”</p>

<p>“Awh, thanks, Mr. Morris, for getting it all in,”
drawled Carroll. “How-de-do, Deering; pray don’t
hesitate to make yourself at home.” He languidly
extended his hand, and allowed Tony to shake it.
“Won’t you honor us, Mr. Morris?” he asked, waving
his hand gracefully in the direction of the deep easy
chair.</p>

<p>“No, thank you; not to-night, Reginald. Be good
enough to explain to Deering the simple rules that
theoretically will govern his behaviour. Lights are
to be out at nine-thirty. Good-night.”</p>

<p>He shook hands with the boys cordially, and left
them alone together. Deering looked curiously about
him, a hundred questions on the tip of his tongue;
which however he refrained from asking, as he saw
Carroll sink back into the Morris chair, extract the
novel that he had slipped under it when he had heard
the knock, and resume reading.</p>

<p>Tony stood for a moment, a trifle disconcerted. He
was a little at loss to know what might be the etiquette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of such an occasion. “I say,” he blurted out
at last, “I think you might put that book down and
tell a fellow a thing or two.”</p>

<p>Carroll placed the book on the table at his side, with
an air of mild surprise. “Dear child,” he murmured
indulgently, “shall we adopt the Socratic method?”</p>

<p>Tony flushed. “What is the Socratic method?”</p>

<p>“You ask questions; I answer&mdash;a few of them.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I have any particular questions
to ask. I supposed we might find something to say
if we tried hard enough. However, if you will tell
me in which room I am to sleep, and at what hour we
are expected to get up, I think I can get on without
troubling you any further.”</p>

<p>“As to the first of your enquiries,” the long languid
youth replied, “as I happen to have the advantage
of being in the Fourth, and to have arrived a day
earlier than you upon the scene of action, I have
chosen the larger one to the right, which is protected
from the early morning sun by a trifling angle of the
exterior wall. A murderous bell will assassinate your
innocent sleep at seven in the morning. The time
that you arise will be determined by the length of
time it takes you to dress and your estimate of the
value of late marks. Breakfast, my Socrates, is at
half-past seven. Are the problems too much for you?”</p>

<p>Tony smiled. “I reckon I can figure them out.”</p>

<p>“You are both tautological and verbose. The
single word ‘reckon’ would have expressed your
meaning quite as accurately and not less elegantly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t go in for elegance.”</p>

<p>Carroll lifted his eyebrows with an air of feigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
surprise, and surveyed Tony for a moment or so
with languid interest. When it appeared that his
new acquaintance had nothing further to say, the
older boy leaned his head wearily back upon his chair,
and took up his book again, holding it open with an
air of heroic patience.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll turn in,” said Tony at last.</p>

<p>“Ah!” murmured Carroll, “in that case, I may bid
you good-night.”</p>

<p>Poor Tony was a little chilled by his reception,
and he flung himself somewhat petulantly out of the
study and into his bedroom. He turned on the light,
undressed quickly, and got into bed. For a long time
he lay thinking; first of Carroll, the elegant, languid,
supercilious Carroll, and rebelled with passionate
inner protest at his fate in being cast to room with
him. Why had it not been Jimmie Lawrence&mdash;clever,
handsome, jolly Jimmie, of the sparkling eyes, and
the good-natured banter? or the likable self-important
Kit, or any one of a dozen or more good fellows he
had run against that day? But the memories of
them appeased him. He felt himself lucky to have
hit it off so well with such as they; and certainly there
was much about the school that he was going to like;
and it was fine to have a room to himself, a privilege
that he had learned was exceptionable with Third
formers and was supposed to be due to a “pull” his
people had with the Doctor; and it was good luck
to be under such a master as Bill Morris, whom he had
already decided was to be his favorite. What a horrible
fate it would have been to have sat next at table
or roomed in the house of Mr. Roylston&mdash;“Gumshoe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Ebenezer,” as the boys called him! or to have had
to submit to Mr. Gray’s sarcasm too often! All
things considered, he felt he was very lucky; and so
he stifled a queer feeling of loneliness and homesickness,
and turned over and tried to go to sleep.</p>

<p>He had heard Carroll moving about for awhile,
and then, as he thought at half-past nine, he had
heard the click of the electric light as it was turned
off, the closing of a study door, and he supposed that
Carroll had also gone to bed.</p>

<p>It was perhaps an hour later that he heard a soft
tapping, repeated once or twice; then presently a
movement in the study, and the creaking of a door
being opened and closed; then the sound of whispering
in the room without. Tony sat up in bed, wide
awake now, and listened intently. In a moment his
bedroom door opened. “Who’s that?” he called.</p>

<p>“Shish! be still! don’t make a sound, or I’ll break
your head.” Somebody fumbled with the switch,
turned the current on, and in a second the bedroom
was flooded with light. Four boys, dressed in crimson
and white jersies and old trousers, with red caps
pulled down over their eyes, crowded into the room.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” cried Tony in a whisper,
springing out of bed.</p>

<p>“Excellent pupil!” drawled Carroll, at this moment
thrusting his head through the doorway, “even in the
moment of excitement he preserves the Socratic
method.”</p>

<p>“What do you want?” Tony repeated, backing
up against his wall, a pathetic but sturdy figure in
his white pajamas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Get into your clothes, and come along,” said a
big fellow, with the air, real or assumed, of a bully.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Where you’re bid.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be hanged if I will.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be hanged if you won’t,” the other rejoined,
advancing toward him menacingly.</p>

<p>“Careful, Chapin!” whispered one of the others, “the
kid’ll squeal in a moment, and we’ll have Bill in
on us.”</p>

<p>“To heck with Bill! I’ll have that kid, or I’ll know
the reason why!”</p>

<p>“Gently, Arthur dear,” murmured Carroll. “Never
resort to force until persuasion is exhausted. Dear
Socrates, we desire the pleasure of your company for
a walk abroad. The hour is unusual, but therefore
the greater is the compliment. My friend Chapin is impetuous
and slightly rude, but I counsel you to accept
his invitation.”</p>

<p>“What do you want with me?” asked Tony, stubbornly.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me to repeat, I beg of you. Time presses,
and the patience of my friends is on the ebb.”</p>

<p>“Hang your friends’ patience!” exclaimed Tony.
“I won’t&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It will hang them, my child, if you do not come.
The effort to remove you by force will cost them no
end of a hanging.”</p>

<p>Tony saw that whatever resistance he might make,
the kind that would save him was tabooed. He had
only to make a noise, of course, and the master of the
house would come to his rescue. Intuition told him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
that this was impossible, as impossible as also he felt
it would be to submit placidly to hazing. Being
southern, Tony had his prejudices. An objection to
interference with his liberty even in the easy-going
fashion of school-life was one of them. He decided
at once that his protest, however, must be made out
of doors, when all chance of attracting the attention of
the masters was over. All this went through his mind
a great deal more quickly than it can be told. As he
made his decision, he pulled on his trousers and a
jersey over the shirt of his pajamas, slipped his feet
into “sneakers,” and professed to be ready.</p>

<p>“Mumm’s the word, through the corridor,” whispered
Chapin, as they slipped out into the dark passage-way,
and cautiously felt their way towards the stairs.
Carroll had condescended to take Tony’s hand, partly
that he might guide him in the dark, partly to make
sure that the boy did not give him the slip.</p>

<p>At last they emerged upon the campus. It was
dark and still. A late moon was casting its waning
light over the hills beyond Strathsey Neck. The boys,
still speaking in whispers, led Tony quickly across
the ghostly campus, and into a field below the chapel,
which sloped down toward the curving beach and sea.
As they evidently meant to take him farther still,
Deering pulled back here, and wrenched his arm free
of Carroll’s grasp.</p>

<p>“I have gone far enough,” he said. “Tell me what
you want of me, here.”</p>

<p>“Biff him, Kid,” exclaimed one of his captors,
in a voice in which the note of brutality sounded
painfully real.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nay, nay, gently,” interposed Carroll. “Let me
deal with Socrates.... We would lead you to the
beach, my friend, where the little lobsters and the
mermaids play, and there have you sing us songs and
make us merry with your quips and jests; while we,
from the recesses of a certain cave well known to us,
extract certain delightful viands, and feast.”</p>

<p>Tony listened patiently to this speech, with an expression
of contempt upon his face that it was fortunate
his captors could not see.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, Carroll,” he said in reply, “go ahead,
if you want to. I tell you frankly, the four of you may
be able to beat me into a pulp, but you are not going
to haze me.”</p>

<p>“No?” with an air of incredulity.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>The irritable member of the party poked Tony in
the ribs at this point, and for his pains got a stinging
blow on the ear. This youth, whose name was Chapin,
was exceedingly angry at this, and Tony’s fate doubtless
would have been settled then and there, had not
the other three interposed, and restrained Chapin’s
efforts to enforce an immediate punishment, protesting
if there was a fight now he would spoil the fun. After
an exciting altercation, which nearly resulted in the
hazing party itself engaging in a civil war, peace was
restored and the five proceeded toward the beach.</p>

<p>They walked some distance along the sands, which
the ebbing tide had left damp and firm, to a point a
little on the nether side of a deep stream, perhaps
twenty yards wide, which divided the beach from a
rocky bit of coast on the farther side. There was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
rocky formation along the shores of this stream in
the shelter of which Chapin soon indicated the mouth
of a natural cave by thrusting his arms deep into
the crevice, and then bringing forth one after another
several large tin boxes and armfuls of fuel.</p>

<p>One boy quickly started a fire in the lee of a rock,
the flame of which was shielded from the view of the
school by the neighboring dunes. The other three,
leaving Tony for the moment to his own devices,
though they kept a watch on him, made preparations
for a feast. From the tin boxes they produced various
canned stuffs, biscuits, sweets, and the like, while the
others began to fry some sausages in a skillet over the
fire. It was probably near midnight, and so thrilling
and so interesting were these proceedings, that for the
moment Tony forgot that he too was not one of them
out for a lark and began to enjoy himself hugely.
Suddenly Chapin took a seat on a rock, and calling
to him sharply, reminded him on what a different
status he was there&mdash;a despised new boy to be hazed
for freshness. He wondered, not without some alarm,
what they proposed to do to him.</p>

<p>At length, just as Carroll handed up to Chapin a
nicely done sausage, Tony’s principal tormentor turned
to him. “Well, Deering, suppose you get up on that rock
there, and give us a sample of your beautiful southern
voice. We’ll have ‘Louisiana Lou,’ if you please.”</p>

<p>Tony felt a cold shiver run down his back, but
nevertheless he braced himself against the rock, instead
of mounting it, and faced Chapin. Thorndyke and
Marsh drew near, and Carroll looked up from where
he was kneeling at the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come along.... Nah!” he snarled, in answer to
some remark of Carroll’s, “I am going to haze this
kid to the limit. Come, step lively there, Deering;
what’s the matter with you? Crawl up on that rock,
or I’ll biff you over the head.”</p>

<p>Tony backed off a little. “I supposed you knew,”
he said, “that I didn’t intend to be hazed when you
brought me down here.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t intend to be hazed!” cried Thorndyke,
a strapping big chap. “Well, I’ll be&mdash;&mdash;What did
you think we asked you to&mdash;a party?</p>

<p>“No,” Tony answered. “But I came because I
didn’t want to raise a rumpus up near the School,
where you might think I was scared and trying to
squeal out of it.”</p>

<p>“So you ain’t trying to squeal now, eh?” asked
Thorndyke.</p>

<p>“Not a bit, but I don’t intend to be hazed all the
same.”</p>

<p>“Why, Socrates, my love, do you expect us to fight
you in rotation so as to convince you of the fact that
you <i>are</i> going to be hazed?” asked Carroll, in tones
of sarcasm.</p>

<p>“Oh, biff him!” cried Chapin.</p>

<p>Tony backed a little. “I don’t expect you to fight
me, no,” he answered; then like a flash he kicked
off his sneakers, slipped off his coat, and cast it full
into Chapin’s face, with his hands behind it, sending
him sprawling over Carroll, and upsetting their fire.
With a cry, he leaped upon the rocks above. “You’ve
got to catch me first.”</p>

<p>There was a chorus of startled exclamations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
then all four started after him, leaping upon the rocks.
Tony ran lightly to the farther side, and then just as
Thorndyke’s face appeared over the ledge behind, he
sprang into the air, off the rocks, and disappeared
beneath the waters of Beaver Creek.</p>

<p>“Wait till the little devil comes up,” cried Marsh,
standing on the brink of the rock and looking at the
bubbling water. “He’ll swim across, but he can’t get
back to the school without coming this way. Two of
you go round by the bridge. Reggie and I’ll wait here.”</p>

<p>Chapin and Marsh started on a run for the bridge,
which spanned the creek along a dune road about a
hundred yards from the beach. Carroll and Thorndyke
watched for the reappearance of Tony on the
surface of the creek, but no Tony reappeared. The
seconds lengthened into minutes; they heard their
two companions stamping across the bridge, but not
a ripple disturbed the dark waters of the creek.</p>

<p>“Good heavens! what’s become of him?” whispered
Thorndyke.</p>

<p>“Nothing!” Carroll responded irritably. “Watch
the opposite bank.”</p>

<p>In a moment more Chapin and Marsh were on the
other side. “Have you seen him?” they called.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t come up yet,” Chapin answered, in an
agitated voice.</p>

<p>“Hasn’t come up yet! Then I’m going in after him!”
and with the words Marsh plunged into the stream.
He floundered about for a moment or so, diving here
and there, but in four or five minutes crawled to shore
exhausted. The others had investigated the bank
to the bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“He must have swum up stream,” suggested Marsh.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t come up to the surface, you ass!” said
Carroll. “Do you think he can swim a hundred yards
under water?”</p>

<p>“What then do you think we are going to do?” he
asked, in ghastly tones.</p>

<p>“Why two of us are going up to Doctor Forester,
and two are going to stay here and keep watch.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think....”</p>

<p>“What, in heaven’s name, can we think?”</p>

<p>Carroll and Marsh started on a run up the beach,
leaving their two companions crouched on the rocks,
peering down fearsomely into the stream. The night
seemed to them to grow colder, darker, more dismal.
The moon in fact had set.</p>

<p>“By Jove, this is rum!” Thorndyke choked, in
a grisly effort to seem at ease.</p>

<p>“It’s ghastly, Harry,” whispered Chapin, as he put
his hand on the other boy’s arm.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pch">“PAX”</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that we share the fright of
the four hazers. Tony of course was not drowned,
nor indeed at any time had he been in danger. He had
not lived on a Mississippi bayou for the greater part
of his life in vain. He was an excellent swimmer,
and he had the knack to an unusual degree of swimming
under water a long distance.</p>

<p>When Chapin had first advanced upon him, he
had intended to fight, but he realized at once that
such a course would be foolish, for he would inevitably
be conquered, and forced in the long run to go through
the “stunts” even in a more unpleasant fashion than
if he submitted at once. He had, however, no intention
of submitting so long as he saw any possibility of a way
out of the situation. Suddenly it occurred to him that
by jumping into the creek and swimming for some
distance under water, he might get a start in the
way of escape that it would be difficult for his pursuers
to make up. In this way the hazing might be
avoided for the night at least, and on the morrow he
could take counsel as to the future with some of his
new-found allies.</p>

<p>No sooner did he think of this stratagem than he
acted upon it. As we have seen, it proved even more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
successful than he had expected or hoped. The
creek was quite deep enough for him to swim a considerable
distance beneath the surface. He headed
up stream, and kept under water to the limit of his
endurance. Then, instead of coming to the surface
in the splashing, sputtering fashion of the amateur,
he came so far up as to thrust only his face above
the waters for breath. So careful were his movements
that the anxious watchers did not detect him
even at this moment. A second time he went below,
swimming beneath the surface for some yards, until
he emerged again, this time within a short distance
of the bridge. A few strokes brought him to this
hiding-place, and he had scarcely ensconced himself
there, clinging to one of the heavy wooden supports,
when he heard Chapin and Marsh rushing across
the planks above his head. He could tell by their
tones of alarm, as they talked farther down the bank,
that they thought he had drowned. He heard one
of them jump into the creek and splash vainly about
for some moments, and at last he heard two of them
depart, and saw the shadowy outlines of the other
two, as they returned disconsolate to wait by the
rocks.</p>

<p>In about five minutes Tony crawled out from his
hiding-place beneath the bridge. He was shivering
with the cold, but otherwise not the worse for his
long immersion. He ran softly along the dune road,
about a hundred yards or so behind Carroll and
Marsh on their way to the school. He followed
them at a safe distance across the meadows and the
campus, and watched them as they rang the bell of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the Head Master’s house. Then he hurried off to
his own room in Standerland, slipped off his wet
clothes, and got into bed. A little alarm as to his
safety on the part of his would-be tormentors, he
thought, would be a just bit of revenge, particularly
against the supercilious Carroll.</p>

<p>While Deering lay comfortably in bed, rapidly
recovering in body and spirit, the two conspirators
had a mournful few minutes as they explained matters
to Doctor Forester, who had thrust his head and his
pyjama’d shoulders out of an upper window.</p>

<p>The Head Master listened to their frightened
explanations. “Very well,” he said at length, “I
will dress at once. In the meantime, one of you go
quickly over to Standerland and see if by any chance
he has returned there. It is possible that there has
been a serious accident, but I think it much more
likely that he has simply outwitted you. I trust
that is the case. Report to me immediately.” And
with that the Doctor closed his window sash with a
bang.</p>

<p>With his heart in his mouth Carroll ran across
the quadrangles to Standerland House, resolving
with more passion than he customarily allowed himself
that the Head had shown himself a brute. He
felt his way along the dark corridor, still cautious,
although convinced that it was but a matter of
moments when the whole school must be alarmed.
He always recalled that walk upstairs as one of the
most disagreeable quarters of an hour of his life. At
last he found his door, entered his study, and breathed
a sigh of relief as he switched on the light. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
cautiously opened the door into Tony’s bedroom,
and gave a frightful start as he saw the boy sitting
up in bed. But Carroll was not one to betray more
than momentary surprise. He gave Tony a long
curious look, sufficiently assured after the first glance
that he was not a ghost. “So, my Socrates,” he said,
“you are back?”</p>

<p>“It would seem so,” answered Tony dryly, and as
the older boy thought, impertinently.</p>

<p>“One wondered, you know,” Carroll remarked
quietly, as he turned off the light and left the room.</p>

<p>In five minutes he was back at the Head Master’s
house. “Deering is in bed, sir,” he reported to the
non-committal head at the upper window.</p>

<p>“Good; I thought so. Do you go now after your
companions on the beach. Return at once; get back
into bed as quietly as you got out of it, and the four
of you report to me to-morrow morning after prayers.
I fancy that whether or not you become the laughing
stock of the school will depend entirely upon yourselves.
Good-night!”</p>

<p>“Good-night, sir.”</p>

<p>Carroll had lost but a trifle of his suavity during
this nocturnal adventure. He hurried off now to
the beach, and explained the situation to Thorndyke
and Chapin, who were so rejoiced to learn that they
had not been the cause of an involuntary suicide that
they forgot to be annoyed with Tony for outwitting
them. It was a cold and dejected trio of boys that
stowed away the remains of the unenjoyed feast,
and then betook themselves up the hill, crept silently
into their dormitories, and went to bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>On the morrow they were excused from first study
and reported to the Head Master. To their surprise
Doctor Forester had very little to say to them. “I
had intended to give you a lecture,” he said, looking
up from his writing and without laying down his pen,
“and probably a severe punishment, but I fancy you
have learned a lesson.... You can see, at least,
to what the hazing of a high-spirited boy might
lead.... I understand your ideas about hazing.
I do not share them. I believe that you will not
disappoint me when I say that I expect the practice
to stop from this day.”</p>

<p>“Quite so, sir,” said Thorndyke.</p>

<p>“And that is all,” added the Doctor, giving them
a nod of dismissal.</p>

<p>“Phew!” exclaimed Chapin, as they entered the
corridor, “that’s sliding out easy.”</p>

<p>“Rather,” answered Thorndyke, “unless we have
the whole school howling at us when the kid squeals.”</p>

<p>“Which he’s sure to do,” suggested Marsh.</p>

<p>Carroll withered them with a glance. “I rather
fancy not,” he drawled. “He’s a southerner and a
gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s hope not,” interposed Thorndyke....
“There, don’t get huffy, Harry, you can’t help coming
from Chicago.”</p>

<p>“Who wants to help it, you big cow?” cried Marsh,
giving his chum Thorndyke a good-natured push
against the wall. “But if I thought, as Carroll does,
that there were not any gentlemen north of Mason and
Dixon’s line, I wouldn’t come to a northern school.”</p>

<p>“Rot!” vouchsafed Carroll. “Let’s whoop her up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
for Gumshoe, and avoid any daffy questions about
being quizzled by the Head.”</p>

<p class="ptb1"><b>********</b></p>

<p>Tony found it difficult the next day not to take
Jimmie Lawrence or Kit Wilson into his confidence,
and tell them of his adventure of the night before.
But he conquered the temptation, for he was singularly
incapable of enjoying himself at the expense
of any one’s else discomfiture. Tony was not without
his faults, as we shall see, but he genuinely disliked
to make other people uncomfortable. Perhaps this
was an inheritance from a long line of ancestors who
had had rather nice ideas about what constitutes
a gentleman. At any rate, he was born that way,
and did not deserve any special credit for it. He
realized that if he told his story he might easily make
his three captors the butts of the school, but that was
not a form of revenge that appealed to him. Accordingly
he held his peace, and if it had depended on him
the story never would have been told. But we may
say in passing, that eventually Carroll told the tale
himself: it entered into the body of Deal tradition,
and is frequently told by old Deal boys when hazing
is a subject of conversation.</p>

<p>Tony felt almost familiar with the schoolroom as
he entered after prayers the next morning. A score
of faces were now known to him, and so many had
seemed friendly as he looked into them, that the
homesick feeling and the alarm of the night before
rapidly passed away. Occasionally he noticed
Mr. Morris’s glance resting upon him, as he sat at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
his books during the day, in a particularly interested
and friendly way. There was something in Morris’s
face&mdash;an attractiveness, perhaps one would call it,
for he was not precisely handsome&mdash;a winningness
in the directness of his glance, that more than once
had won boys at almost first sight. Morris had the
genius of inspiring enthusiasms, and he was to inspire
one in Tony. The master was soon to hear from
Carroll the inwardness of Tony’s exploits, and marvel
with him at the boy’s “whiteness” in not talking.
Mr. Morris was the occasional recipient of the intimate
confidences of the supercilious Virginian, for
even Carroll had moments of weakness when he felt
the need of unburdening himself and receiving
sympathy&mdash;moments, as he would have said, when
he was not himself.</p>

<p>As the day wore on Tony was inclined to forget
his unpleasant adventure of the night before. The
afternoon found him again on the football field,
absorbed in learning the game, and winning encomiums
in the eyes of Kit, who until Thanksgiving would have
few thoughts aside from football. Kit was captain
of his form eleven, and his interest in its success was
equaled only by the readiness with which he would
sacrifice his best players to the school team or even
to the scrub if they were needed. He was delighted
with Deering’s advent, as he had felt he was weak in
ends, and Tony’s fleetness promised much in that
direction.</p>

<p>The likelihood of his securing a position on his
form team gave Deering a prestige that stood him
in good stead as a new boy; and as he was lively,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
good-natured and appreciative, it seemed that on
the whole he would have an agreeable time.</p>

<p>There was, however, a rift in the lute&mdash;which Tony
detected the second day of his school life. As he
would pass Chapin in the Schoolhouse corridors or
on the campus, he could see by the expression on his
face that he had taken the result of their adventures
of the night before in bad part. They exchanged
no words on the subject, but Chapin’s behavior was in
such contrast to that of Thorndyke and Marsh, or
even of Carroll, all of whom had smiled good-naturedly
when they had met him, that he put it down that in
Chapin he had made an enemy. At the time this
troubled him very little. He wondered of course
if he should be hazed again, but surmised correctly
that if he were it would not be by the same crowd.</p>

<p>The spirit with which he went into things, his
success on the form team, and the powerful friends
that he had made in Wilson and Lawrence, the leaders
of the Third, soon secured him an immunity from
hazing in any form. The Sixth frowned on the custom,
so that none but adventurous spirits were apt to
attempt it.</p>

<p>Tony was tired out that night, and as soon as he
was dismissed from the schoolroom at nine o’clock,
he ran over to Standerland and got into bed, scarcely
noticing Carroll, who had the privilege of working
in their common study. Hardly, however, was he in
bed, than the door was opened, his light switched on,
and again Carroll appeared, but this time there was
a friendly grin on his face, and a box of biscuit and
a jar of jam tucked under his arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t jump, my philosopher!” he exclaimed,
“I am alone and unarmed.” Then he advanced to
the bed, and held out his hand. “Shall we make it
‘pax’?”</p>

<p>“With all my heart,” laughed Tony, and gave
Carroll’s hand a friendly shake.</p>

<p>“Suppose then we smoke a pipe of peace,” and
Carroll extracted from the recesses of his pocket two
brierwood pipes.</p>

<p>“Hang it!” said Tony, “I don’t smoke, you know.
Aren’t you afraid of getting caught?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, somewhat,” answered Carroll, as he nonchalantly
lighted a match. “But what will you have?
School bores me to extinction. I find myself within
two days craving nefarious excitement. You are fortunate
to possess a calmer temperament. Here, help
yourself to the jam and biscuit.”</p>

<p>“You seem calm enough,” commented Tony.</p>

<p>“I assume that, little one, for amusement, I am in
reality excitable to a degree. Now take that incident
last night&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s drop that,” said Tony.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I should like to discuss it. I
was rather a beast to go in for it, you know, when
you had been, as it were, put in my tender care. It
was the fun of doing something that one knew would
get one into trouble if one were caught. You behaved
in a singular fashion, I must confess, and lamentably
upset our little calculations. Somehow, after blowing
the business to the Head the joy of the affair was
gone. I felt like a sick cat when I crawled into bed
at one <span class="smcap">A. M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></span>”</p>

<p>“What happened?” asked Tony.</p>

<p>Carroll took a deep pull at his pipe, and blew the
smoke out of the window. “Old Hawk laughed at us,
and sent us to bed as though we were First Formers.
Say, it was rather decent of you, you know, not to
peach to the fellows.”</p>

<p>“How do you know I didn’t?”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve escaped the jolly horsing we’d have
got if you had, that’s all.... Do you know, I approve
of that,&mdash;well, to a degree. Confound it! there’s curfew.
Lie still, I’ll souse the light. I guess we’re
safe enough. Bill saw us both in, and he isn’t one to
nose about after lights unless there’s a beastly noise.
Bill is such a gentleman that one hates to take advantage
of his considerateness,&mdash;like this!” And he
blew a puff of smoke into Tony’s face.</p>

<p>“Why do you do it then?”</p>

<p>Carroll got up and turned out the light; then
resumed his seat on Tony’s bed.</p>

<p>“Why do I? Hang it, Deering, I sometimes wonder
why I do a number of things. I’ve a great notion
to chuck it.”</p>

<p>Tony had the good sense to make no reply to this
remark, but to munch instead with rather unctious
enjoyment on his biscuit and jam. Carroll seemed
to meditate for the moment in the dark, then knocked
his ashes out on the window-sill, and leaned over,
feeling for the jar. “Where the deuce is the biscuit?
That jam is the real article, you know. There is a
great gulf between the jam I use and what one gets
in the refectory. Would that in that gulf we might
souse the housekeeper, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>And so they talked the shop and jargon, the boyish
confidences, and experiences, and plans, that have
been the theme of nocturnal talks ever since schools
were invented. It was quite late before Carroll
returned to his bedroom, and Tony immediately
dropped to sleep, feeling that after all he had misjudged
him upon first appearances. His next conscious
thought was as he leaped to his feet in answer
to the strident tones of the rising bell.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pch">MICHAELMAS TERM</p>

<p>This late talk with Carroll did more toward putting
Tony at his ease in the school than perhaps anything
that happened to him. From that time on he became
very friendly with his room-mate&mdash;all the better friends
doubtless because they always maintained toward each
other a certain reserve, due rather to Carroll’s involuntary
elaborateness of manner than to any deliberate
effort on their part. All the better also was it that real
as was their mutual regard for each other neither had
that enthusiastic affection that school boys so frequently
experience, and of which Tony was already
aware in another direction. For just such a friendship
quickly developed between him and Jimmie Lawrence.</p>

<p>He has missed one of the purest joys of life who has
not known the delights of an enthusiastic boyish friendship.
It has its sweetnesses, its fears and scruples, as
has every other love; but there is a cloudless carelessness
about its happy days as about no other period of life.
For Tony, in that first Indian summer at Deal to
wander off from the common fields with Jimmie Lawrence,
into unfamiliar haunts, into the enchanted region
of Lovel’s Woods, or along the rocky kelp-strewn
shores of the Strathsey River or the tawny beaches
of the Neck, was a joy pure and unalloyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Among others Carroll watched the development of
this friendship with interest. Carroll was not the
sort to give his affection quickly in such whole-hearted
fashion, though he cared deeply enough about things,
he thought. He neither approved nor disapproved of
his room-mate’s devotion to Jimmie, certainly was not
jealous of it. If such things must be&mdash;he had a way
of smiling with his assumed air of cynicism when
friendship was mentioned&mdash;why he supposed Jimmie
Lawrence was as worthy of Tony’s devotion as the
next boy. Carroll never spoke of this friendship to
Tony, but tactfully began to welcome Jimmie as a
visitor to their rooms during that fall term. To his
own form-mates he referred to his study as “the
kindergarten.” He did, however, speak unusually
frankly to Tony of another friendship which that
youth appeared to have made. They had wandered
toward the beach one evening. Football practice
was just over; Tony had had his bath and was glowing
a beautiful pink and white in the soft air of the Indian
summer twilight.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” said Carroll, flecking at the
pebbles in the sands, as they stopped at the creek,
“that you have made a great hit with our beloved
Bill?”</p>

<p>Tony laughed. “Bill’s made a great hit with me,
I may say. But doubtless that’s plain enough.”</p>

<p>“Oh, perfectly,” answered Carroll who was used
to boys liking Mr. Morris, “but it has never been
evident before that Bill has particularly cared for one
of us rather than for another; he has been extraordinarily
decent to everyone with whom he has to do,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
just as Gumshoe has been extraordinarily odious.
For myself, I have always disliked intensely the
attitude that most school masters think it expedient
to assume&mdash;to wit, a sort of official consciousness of
a universal <i>in loco parentis</i>, a grim determination to
make people think every boy is liked just in the
same way, which we know is impossible, and as undesirable
as it is unreal. Witness, Gumshoe really
makes me grateful to him, despite his native hideousness,
because he never addresses me without a sarcastic
snarl or an odious grin as though I were amusing
him. One understands that amusement.”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite,” said Tony, absently.</p>

<p>Reggie did not like these little interjections in his
monologue. “Don’t assume to be paying attention,”
he commented now. “I know of course that you are
not until I get back to you. Don’t think it necessary
to assent. I am accustomed to talking without
being listened to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up, Reggie, go on with Bill&mdash;what about
him?”</p>

<p>“Ah, I thought our curiosity had been aroused.
This, little one; he had succeeded better than most
people in liking a good many fellows, with the result
of course that the fellows really like him. But, for
you, his liking is more patent than usual. I congratulate
you&mdash;not to say, I envy you.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” began Tony.</p>

<p>“Cultivate him, my boy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I mean to do that,” Deering answered. “Tell
me, do you like Mr. Morris, Reggie; you’re such a&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I, oh I adore him,&mdash;in my way; but even so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
is between you and me. He is a demi-god, the superman.
As for me, I amuse him, interest him, baffle
him a little, I hope; but he will never be fond of
me. It will be a relief to Bill when I get out of his
house.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it’s just that he’s never been sure
whether or not he could trust you?” asked Tony.</p>

<p>Carroll for once started. “Trust me? Good heavens,
Deering, I imagine the man takes me for a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, that&mdash;I meant rather in other ways;
if he counts on you to help out....”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Carroll exclaimed, with a tone of relief,
“I dare say not.... I dare say not....” And
for a while he seemed to think rather seriously.
Tony wondered to himself how he had happened to
stumble on what doubtless was a sore spot with his
room-mate in his relation to the house-master. As for
Carroll’s talk about Mr. Morris’s good opinion, Tony
only took that half seriously. He hoped it was true,
of course. Tony liked to be liked, as perhaps most
people do.</p>

<p>Those were really golden days for him, which he was
always to recall with a peculiar sense of pleasure.
He was consciously happier than he had ever been
before, because often at home there had been certain
family shadows that dimmed the day. Life went
well with him that first fall term. He seemed to
catch the spirit of the school almost by intuition;
indeed, as he said to himself one afternoon as he stood
on the terrace in front of the Old School, looking down
across the sloping meadows, past the ochre-colored
beach, out upon Deigr Rock and a quivering ocean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
it was in his blood: it was his inheritance and tradition
to be a part of and to love Deal School.</p>

<p>He was quick and sensible enough to keep his
classroom work up to the average, and though he did
not distinguish himself as a scholar, he suffered very
little from detention or pensums, those popular devices
for the torture of the dull and the lazy. He had his
long afternoons free, save for football. And football
in that day, under what Tony ever felt was a wise
dispensation of the Head’s, was never allowed to
absorb more than an hour, except when a game was
on. As it was, he always had a good hour or so of daylight
in which with a congenial companion,&mdash;Jimmie,
or Kit, or Carroll, often,&mdash;he could explore the surrounding
country. And this for Tony soon became
the most fascinating way of spending his time. Before
the Michaelmas term was over he had got to know
every path and by-way for five miles roundabout.
To a boy who had eyes as well as wits there was a
plenty to interest him in the region about Deal;&mdash;the
bold and varied shore, with its rocks and beaches,
its coves and caves, its points and necks, the abode
of wild fowl of the sea; the rolling fertile country to
the north; Lovel’s Woods; the quiet waters of Deal
Great Pond; the quaint streets of the old town of
Monday Port, with its rotting wharves and empty
harbor.</p>

<p>This strange old town, despite everywhere the
lingering touch of the summer invasion, with its
suggestion of a vanished trade, in the winter was
bereft of all save its memories of a bygone order of
things; and with these memories, to an imaginative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
boy, the town seemed heavy. It required a special
permission and a good excuse for any of the schoolboys,
except the Sixth, to get the freedom of its streets.
Tony was especially keen for such excuses and such
freedom. His first walk there had been with Mr. Morris,
who seemed to know the intimate stories of its
houses, to be familiar with all its little secrets. In
less conventional conversations Tony planned escapades
for that direction; but as yet nothing very definite
suggested itself. The penalties for being caught in
Monday Port without the good excuse were considered
excessive and usually not worth the risk. Mr. Morris
had a glorious tale of the days when he was a schoolboy
at Deal, of the actual exodus from the school by
night of the whole Fifth, the boarding of a schooner
that had lain dreaming in the sleepy harbor for a day
or so, a thrilling sail into the open, and the overhauling
of the pirate crew by the Head in a steam-launch.
Those were the good old days of birching, and yes,
Mr. Morris had caught it. He had smiled at the
memory as if it were a pleasant one.</p>

<p>Golden days that more and more took the aspect
of holidays as midst school strain and throbbing
excitement, they drew near the day of the “great
game” with Boxford, the rival school across the
Smoke mountains.</p>

<p>It had seemed possible for some time that Tony
might make end on the School team. Mr. Stenton,
the athletic director, though he had a vigorous
way of finding fault, forever threatening the boys
with defeat and the benches and fines, secretly regarded
Deering as a “find.” He had watched his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
play for a week or two on Kit Wilson’s Third Form
team; saw that he was green but teachable, and judged
that he was one of the swiftest runners that had ever
come to Deal. The end of the first month found
Tony a member of the School squad.</p>

<p>To the old boys it seemed almost “fresh” that a
newcomer should be able to play football so much
better than they, and to be a greenhorn at that!
But Jack Stenton knew his business; he was an old
Kingsbridge man, and he had played on the Kingsbridge
eleven in the very earliest days of American
football, when it was a very different game indeed.
And Stenton made up his mind that Tony eventually
should make the Kingsbridge eleven. Deal boys had
not been taking many places on Kingsbridge teams
of recent years, which was a matter of real grief
to the faithful coach. Stenton, however, was the
last man in the world to give a boy a good opinion
of himself, so that he pretended to hold out to Tony
but the smallest hope. “You may squeeze into shape,”
he would say, “but I doubt it.” And in truth he was
averse to playing a new boy in a big game; so that up
to the eve of the Boxford game the line-up was in
doubt. Tony had a vigorous rival for his position,
in Henry Marsh, one of the members of the hazing-bee
of the first few nights at Deal. Marsh was quick;
Tony was quicker; but Marsh had the advantage
of knowing the game, and clever as Tony was proving
himself, he nevertheless was a greenhorn.</p>

<p>His promotion to the school squad did a great deal
for Deering in the way of increasing his popularity.
Kit Wilson no longer patronized him; on the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
hand he was rather proud of Tony’s friendship, and
took a good deal of credit to himself for having discovered
him. He proposed Deering for membership in
the Dealonian, a semi-secret society that took a great
deal of credit to itself for the smooth and successful
running of the School. Membership in it was an
honor, which a new boy rarely achieved. It was
enough to have turned our friend’s head, but he
was singularly not a self-conscious youth, and to
this it was due that his quick success aroused so
little jealousy. Tony had the quality of lovableness
to a marked degree, which is after all a quality; it
was what won him at college in later years the nickname
of “Sunshine,” a famous nickname in the annals
of Kingsbridge, as Kingsbridgeans know&mdash;but that’s
another story.</p>

<p>In all the unexpected happiness of the term there
was for Tony nevertheless the inevitable rift in the
lute. Chapin was still sulky toward him; and he
could see beneath a rather elaborate courtesy, that
Henry Marsh, Chapin’s particular crony, was anything
but friendly. This lack of friendliness became
so noticeable to Carroll that despite his intimacy
with the two, he began to draw somewhat away from
them. Carroll thought that they had singularly
failed to appreciate Tony’s “whiteness” in saving
them all from an unmerciful horsing. Even the
Head Master had called their attention to that in his
brief discourse to them on that unpleasant morning
afterwards.</p>

<p>Carroll met the two coming out of Thornton Hall&mdash;the
refectory&mdash;one evening after supper, and joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
them as they walked around the terrace in the moonlight.</p>

<p>“I say, you fellows,” he began, plunging <i>in medias
res</i>&mdash;Carroll always took the unexpected line&mdash;“why
the deuce do you keep so sour on young Deering?”</p>

<p>Chapin looked up quickly, his eyes glinting unpleasantly
in the moonlight. “Hang it, Carroll!”
he exclaimed, “what’s that to you? We’ve no obligation
to take up with every little southern beggar
that comes to school, as you seem to have.”</p>

<p>“No, assuredly,” Carroll replied, suavely, “but
it occurs to me that when a chap has behaved as
uncommonly decently to us as Deering has, you
might show a little&mdash;well, appreciation.”</p>

<p>“Rot! Deering has had a swelled head ever since
the night of the hazing-bee, and if Jack Stenton sticks
him on the team for the Boxford game there’ll be no
holding him. We will be for sending him up to
Kingsbridge instanter.”</p>

<p>“You are uttering unspeakable nonsense, my dear
Arthur, and you know it. Give the lad a show;
play fair. What’s the matter with you, Harry?”
he added, turning to Marsh, “it is only lately that
you have taken to snubbing him.”</p>

<p>Marsh gave an uneasy laugh. “Oh, Arty and me
hang together,” he said lamely.</p>

<p>“Well, that is more than you can say for your
English,” remarked Carroll, with a contemptuous
smile, and turned away.</p>

<p>Chapin followed him up, and laid an arm upon his
shoulder. “Look here, Reggie,” he exclaimed, “don’t
let’s bicker about this kid. I don’t like him, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
what difference need that make between us? We have
stuck pretty close these four years. Come on now,
let’s slip down to the cave, hit the pipe, and talk
things over.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” replied Carroll briefly.</p>

<p>“Come on, Reggie, do,” put in Marsh, “we’ve
bagged a bottle of wine to-day, and we’ll bust it
to-night in your honor.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, no; seductive as your offering is, I rather
fancy you may count me out of your little meetings
in the future.” And with the words Carroll went on
his way.</p>

<p>The two boys looked after him a moment, until
he entered the Old School, when Chapin exclaimed,
with an oath, “Let him go, Harry; we’ll count him
out all right; but we’ll get even with his cub.”</p>

<p>Marsh murmured an assent, but hung back a little
when Chapin renewed the proposal to visit the cave
on the beach. “Don’t let us go to-night, Art; remember
you’re in training.”</p>

<p>“The deuce with training. What’s the use of banging
your head against a football for a month if a
greenhorn like that is to be shoved into the front row
at the last moment. I’m going to have some fun
nights, and you’ll see, I shall be as fit as a fiddle in
the morning anyway.” And as he spoke, he drew
Marsh’s arm within his, and together they started for
the beach.</p>

<p>From that day Carroll avoided them, a circumstance
that did not increase their friendliness toward Tony.
It had been comparatively easy at the time for Reginald
to take the course he did, but as the days came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and went, he began to miss the companionship of
Chapin and Marsh more than he cared to acknowledge.
Although naturally there was little in common
between them, for so long a time he had identified
himself with them and their crowd,&mdash;attracted by
their willingness to engage upon any lark however
wild and their keenness to avoid school rules, a process
to which his own languid existence had been secretly
dedicated,&mdash;that he keenly missed the nefarious
exploits their companionship afforded. To be sure
he had stopped smoking, he was bracing up a bit
and helping Mr. Morris out with the discipline of
the house, but beyond that he craved as ardently
as ever the excitement and adventure of his more
careless days.</p>

<p>At that moment he was ripe to have entered into
a closer intimacy with Tony, or even with Mr. Morris.
But Deering was absorbed in the life of his form, and
except at night he and Carroll had no opportunity
of being together, and then Tony was so tired out
with football practice that by “lights” he was ready
to tumble into bed. And so they fell quite out of the
way of having nocturnal talks. Mr. Morris had a
great liking for Carroll, despite his obvious faults,
but he had long since given up the hope of knowing
him better, of getting beyond Carroll’s supercilious
reserve and too-elaborate courtesy. The consequence
was that he detected no change now in the boy’s
attitude and failed to make the advances that Carroll
would have responded to so readily. For the first
time Carroll became seriously dissatisfied with his
life at school. He was really bored, as he had always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
pretended to be, and also lonely, which of course
he did not acknowledge, even to himself. He was a
little inclined to think in his heart that his half-conscious
efforts at reform were not worth while.
However he decided to stick it out for the year at
any rate, and settled down to the monotonous routine
with an air of indifference, and kept steadily away
from his old companions.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pch">THE BOXFORD GAME</p>

<p>The first cold snap gave way again to Indian summer
with just enough northwest wind to make good football
weather. The practice went on diligently. Lesser
rivals came week by week to Deal and literally and
metaphorically bit the dust ere the great Boxford
game drew near. The school was a-quiver with excitement.
The form leaders marshalled the boys onto the
field in the bright clear afternoons and stimulated them
to cheer until they were hoarse. The <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> of
winning were the principal theme of conversation
during recreation times, and hours and minutes were
counted as the great day came nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>The day before the game a mass meeting was held
in the Gymnasium, and the Head and Mr. Stenton
and such other masters as had athletic proclivities
were called upon for speeches, while the boys cheered
everything enthusiastically without discrimination.
Sandy Maclaren, the doughty captain of the eleven,
mounted the rostrum amongst others, and delivered
his sentiments in a terse series of twelve stammering
words, “Boys, we’ve got to win; and that’s all I have
to say,” which was greeted with an applause that
more skilled orators seldom evoke. The form games
were over, and the form teams had disbanded; all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
effort was concentrated now upon the chief game of
the year.</p>

<p>Tony, from his place amongst the scrub players,
heard it all with tingling ears and beating heart,
absorbing that intangible energy&mdash;school spirit&mdash;as
air into his lungs. This unexpected and vehement
stirring of his emotions bewildered him. He thought
he was just beginning to understand what love of
school might mean. Then they sang “Here’s to good
old Deal” and “There’s a wind that blows o’er the
sea-girt isle” in a fashion that brought the heart to
the throat and tears of exquisite happiness to the
eyes. And at last Doctor Forester dismissed them
with a few encouraging words that sounded very much
like a blessing.</p>

<p>Jimmie Lawrence sought Tony’s side, as the boys
poured out of the Gymnasium. “Hey, Tony, ain’t it
grand?” he exclaimed, as he twined his arms around
his friend’s neck. “Oh, say, boy, we’ve <i>got</i> to win.”</p>

<p>Tony gave a little gulp and squeezed Jimmie’s
hand. “Oh, Jimmie, I never felt so great in all my
life.”</p>

<p>The night before the game they were in Jimmie’s
rooms in Standerland and a crowd of Third Formers
came trooping in. “No school to-night,” cried Kit
Wilson, “there’s to be a P-rade around the campus
at eight-thirty sharp. Tony, you lucky dog, don’t it
feel good even to be a despised scrub?”</p>

<p>Tony laughed. “Say, fellows, you don’t know how
it all strikes a greenhorn like me. Why, it makes me
feel bully to be alive.” And as he stood there in the
center of the room, with smiling friendly faces about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
him, health and excitement glowing in his cheeks
and a happy smile playing on his boyish lips, there
was an unconscious feeling within them all that it
was bully for him to be alive.</p>

<p>Rush Merton, an irrepressible, black eyed, black
haired youth, proposed a fresh song and started to
bellow it forth, but the boys were keen for talk and
promptly smothered him with sofa pillows&mdash;an assault
that was resented so violently that in much less time
than it takes to tell Jimmie’s attractive rooms were
in that sad condition, technically known as “rough-house.”
In the midst of the hubbub a stentorian
voice made itself heard, “Here stop this nonsense!”
And Jack Stenton, the hardy popular athletic director,
came in. “Don’t make nuisances of yourselves,
children. Pick up those sofa pillows, compose yourselves,
and listen to words of wisdom from an older
and wiser man.”</p>

<p>“Hear, hear!” came in boisterous good-nature from
a dozen throats. Rush gathered himself together
from the pile of cushions, made an absurd bow, and
indicated Mr. Stenton with a pompous wave of the
hand. “Gentlemen, I yield the center of attention
(and the center of gravity,” he added <i>sotto voce</i>) “to
our beloved athletic director. Mr. Athletic Director,
we are all ears.”</p>

<p>“Good! You are all Third Formers, eh?” said
Stenton, with a smile, as he looked them over good-naturedly.
“I fancied that I might find you congregated
in this den of iniquity. Well, I have come up
here to tell you fellows how much I appreciate Kit
Wilson’s spirit in cheerfully giving his best form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
players to the scrub. He has set an example to the
other forms that is bound to be a fine thing for the
athletics of the school. And I want to tell you also
that the form, this time, is going to get something
out of it&mdash;an honor that I don’t think has fallen to
the Third Form previous to this in the history of
Deal School. After due consideration Captain Maclaren
and I have decided to play Deering at left end
in to-morrow’s game.”</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence, due to the overwhelming
surprise, for they had hardly dared hope
that Tony would be given a chance except as a substitute;
and this meant that he had won out against
Marsh who had played on the team last year. Deering
himself looked in helpless amazement, first at Stenton,
then at his form mates. Jimmie broke the stillness
at last by exclaiming in a shrill voice, “Come to my
arms, my frabjous boy,” and clasped Tony wildly
about the waist. Then the cheers rang forth, despite
Stenton’s protest, until Mr. Morris came running
out of his study to find out what the racket was.</p>

<p>“Come, come,” Mr. Stenton cried at last, “cut this
now; and you, young ‘un, get to bed and don’t celebrate
any more to-night. Hello, Mr. Morris, we have
decided to put Deering in the game to-morrow&mdash;hence
this bedlam.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine!” exclaimed Morris heartily, as he
shook Tony’s hand. “But you boys had better get
out now and join the procession; they are meeting
before the Chapel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>At last they were gone, having wrung Tony’s hand
two or three times each, and Deering and Lawrence
were left alone. For a moment neither boy spoke,
but stood looking at each other, their eyes glistening
with friendliness that had been heightened by the
excitement and the common joy. Jimmie was as
unaffectedly glad as if the honor had come to him.
Then Tony slipped into a chair by the window, and
putting his head upon his hands stared out upon the
campus, which was beginning to be covered with
groups of boys, converging toward the Chapel. “I
wish old Jack had let me go out and help celebrate,”
he said, with a little laugh. “I can’t sleep if I do go
to bed.”</p>

<p>Jimmie sat down on the chair, and slipped his arm
about Tony’s neck. “You must, dear old boy, all
the same; ‘cause you’ve got to win for us.”</p>

<p>Tony laughed, and clasping Jimmie’s hand, he
looked up at him with a sudden seriousness that in
after days Jimmie was to recall as having been profoundly
significant. “Jim,” he said, “I know that
Sandy and Larry Cummings and Chapin and the rest
of ‘em can play football a thousand times better than I
will ever do, but just the same there’s something that
kind of tells me that I am going to have my chance to-morrow
in a special way. I must do something to
prove to Jack and Sandy that they aren’t making a
mistake. Oh, Jim, you don’t know how I feel&mdash;awfully
puffed up and absurdly small. I wish it were you.”</p>

<p>“You’re all right, old boy; and Sandy and Jack
know their business a blame sight better than we do.
Now cut it for bed, and I’ll go out and help make the
night hideous.”</p>

<p>In his own rooms, where Tony went as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Jimmie left him, he found Carroll deep in a Morris chair
and the pages of a French novel. “Hello, Reggie,” he
cried, “aren’t you going to p-rade?”</p>

<p>“Not I, kiddo,” answered Carroll, indifferently.
“I fancy I’ve reached that patriarchal age, in spirit
if not in the flesh, when one puts away childish things.
I am mildly moved, however, to go and tell Stenton
and Maclaren that I approve of them, but I’ll content
myself with saying that to you. It is worth while to
have swift-moving pedalities, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“So it seems,” Tony muttered, a little disappointed
by the coolness of his friend’s tone. “Well, good-night,”
he added, “I am going to turn in.”</p>

<p>Carroll had not meant to be supercilious, and for
a moment after Tony left him, avoiding his glance
as he had, he laid down his novel and started toward
Deering’s bedroom. His hand was almost on the
knob, the generous hearty words on his lips, but he
hesitated, and at last turned back and took up his
book. The study door was open, and at that moment
Mr. Morris paused at it, evidently on his way to the
campus.</p>

<p>“Not celebrating, Reginald?” he enquired.</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Morris,” answered Carroll, rising.</p>

<p>A momentary wave of anger swept over Morris’s
strong kindly face. “Is it that your school spirit
is so slack or that your French novel is so absorbing?”</p>

<p>Carroll bowed with an icy politeness. “I am afraid,
Mr. Morris,” he said at last, with compressed lips,
“that whichever explanation I gave would mean the
same to you.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid it would, Reginald,” said Mr. Morris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
as he turned away, with something like a sigh. “Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, sir.”</p>

<p>Carroll sat for a long time without reading, listening
to the shouts upon the campus. At length he picked
up his novel, went into his bedroom, and undressed.
Before getting into bed, he darkened his transom,
lighted a small electric night-lamp, and laid a pad and
pencil on the table by his bedside. For an hour or
more, long after the excitement had ebbed without
and the boys had got back and gone noisily to bed,
long after he had heard the watchman make his
stealthy midnight rounds, Carroll sat there in bed,
gazing dreamily out of his window upon the moonlit
sea and the misty outlines of Lovel’s Woods and at
the ruby intermittent glow of Deigr Light, and now
and then he jotted down a line or word upon the pad.
This was what he wrote:</p>

<p class="pph8 p1">The pure stars shine above the flowing sea,<br />
The strand is gleaming in the moon’s soft light,</p>
<p class="pph8">The south wind blows across the murky lea,<br />
The lamps of Monday glimmer in the night.</p>

<p class="pph8 p1">The moon sags slowly in the violet west,<br />
A yellow crescent, cloud-hung all about,</p>
<p class="pph8">As though in weariness it sinks to rest,<br />
And one by one the glowing lamps go out.</p>

<p class="pph8">So flutter all the little weary souls<br />
In trembling dreams a moment and are still;</p>
<p class="pph8">The school is wrapped in darkness; on the shoals<br />
The tide turns; night enfolds the silent hill.</p>

<p class="ptb1"><b>*********</b></p>

<p>The day of the game turned out bright and fair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
after a dull gray morning, with ozone and freshness
in the nippy air of early November. Recitations of
a sort were held in the morning, though to be sure most
of the masters fell into reminiscent vein and àpropos
of nothing at all told their classes stories of the bygone
heroes of the School&mdash;of Nifty Turner’s mighty
kick and Pard’s immortal run from the enemy’s
ten-yard line. Mr. Roylston alone had the ability
and the temerity to hold his form down to an unrelieved
discussion of the sequence of tenses in <i>Cæsar</i>
and mercilessly put Kit Wilson into detention for
misconstruing an obvious Imperfect with the remark,
“I guess to-day it is an Historical Present.” Kit
served his detention and passed into history.</p>

<p>The team, including Tony in a brand-new red
sweater with a gorgeous black “D” across the breast,
were excused from school at noon, and had dinner
in the Refectory with the Boxfordians, who had
coached across the hills in the morning. By two
o’clock the teams were on the field, passing footballs,
catching punts and kicking goals in regulation fashion.</p>

<p>The boys poured out of the Schoolhouse after two
o’clock call-over, and crowded the side lines, while
the faculty and their wives and distinguished visitors
from Boxford and Monday Port filled the line of
wooden bleachers which had been run up the day
before.</p>

<p>Doctor Forester and the Head Master of Boxford
walked up and down within the lines, repeating
the same amiable courtesies and remarks about the
weather and the view and the condition of the teams
that they had made for years, as though this were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
first instead of the twentieth struggle in which Deal
and Boxford had been engaged. It was a specially
important game, as the score in games between the
two schools was a tie.</p>

<p>The present scribe, who was not a football player,
cannot undertake to describe that eventful game
in technical language. The intricacies of formation
and mass play were beyond his humble abilities at
school, as he has no doubt they are to the majority of
people who nevertheless follow the game with as keen
interest as if they knew it. That is to say, it is inconceivable
to him, that anything could be quite
as exciting to a Deal boy or a Kingsbridge man as to
see his school or college team pressing nearer and
nearer the coveted goal, or to watch a fleet-footed
boy dodge through a broken field, sprint as though
the fate of empires hung upon his fleetness, and
sprawl gloriously at last behind the enemy’s line on
top of the ball. The technically curious are referred
to Vol. LX, No. 2 of the <i>Deal Literary Magazine</i>,
where they will find a more accurate account than
they certainly will find in the pages of this chronicle.
They will miss there, however, an incident, which
impresses the scribe as having been the most important
of the game.</p>

<p>Suffice it, the ball was kicked off at three o’clock
by the Boxford center, and went sailing down the
field into the arms of Sandy Maclaren on the ten-yard
line, and eleven blue-garbed Boxfordians went
chasing after it lipity-cut. Here one described a
graceful parabola as his knees encountered the hardy
back of Arthur Chapin, another went flying off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
involuntarily in a reverse direction as he caught
Deering’s hand in his ribs, but one, surer than the rest,
dived for a tackle and laid Sandy low just as he was
crossing the thirty-yard line. Cheers rang out indiscriminately
from both sides of the field, until the
scattered teams had run together, and, kneeling face
to face, with hands clenched, faces grimly set, the
muscles a-quiver, waited while Kid Drayton, Deal’s
little quarter-back, gave the signals in his high shrill
voice, “Forty-nine, eleven, sixteen.” Then the ball
was snapped, and Chapin, the half-back, was hurled
through a hole in Boxford’s line for a gain of seven
yards. Once, twice, thrice, the Deal boys made their
distance to the indescribable joy of their supporters.
Then the Boxford team, recovering from the unexpected
strength of the first onslaught, stiffened and
became as a stone wall, and held Deal for three downs,
so that Thorndyke, the full-back, dropped behind
for a kick. The oval went spinning through the air,
Tony speeding away almost under it, dodging the
player who tried to intercept him, so that as the
Boxford half leaned back to catch the ball, he
downed him in his tracks. For the first time Tony
heard the <i>Sis</i>, <i>Boom</i>, <i>Ah!</i> of the rippling cheer ring
out with his own name tacked on to the end of it.</p>

<p>Back and forth, now tucked tight under the arm of
a red or a blue sweater, now sailing luxuriously in
the air, the ball was worked over the field; near Boxford’s
goal, near Deal’s; or worried like a rat by a
pack of terriers in the middle of the gridiron. The
two teams were almost equally matched, and the
first half ended without a score.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are doing well, young ‘un,” said Stenton to
Tony, as he stood in the center of the Deal team in
the locker-rooms under the Gymnasium between the
halves. “Give him a chance, Drayton, and send him
around right end. I think it will work.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir,” the little quarter-back squeaked.
“I’ve been counting on Chapin mostly, but toward
the end he seemed to be completely tuckered.”</p>

<p>Chapin looked up from the bench where he was
sitting. “You were so blame winded yourself that you
could hardly give the signals,” he snarled.</p>

<p>“Drop that kind of talk!” exclaimed Stenton.
“You have been playing like a tackling dummy for the
last ten minutes. If you want to lose the game for
us keep that up.”</p>

<p>“I am playing the best game I know,” Chapin
answered surlily. “If you don’t like it,” he muttered,
though Stenton did not hear him, “go get another of
your Third Form pets. You chucked Marsh, one of
your best players.”</p>

<p>The second half opened, and each team seemed to
come back fresher to the fray. With a few trifling
exceptions there had been no injuries. Chapin seemed
the only boy on whom the strain was telling, and
Stenton correctly surmised that that was because
he had not been keeping training. And as a matter
of fact at a fatal moment his form told. The ball had
been worked down well toward Deal’s goal line, and
each time through Chapin. Suddenly the Boxford
full-back dropped back for a kick: the center sent
the ball spinning to him, and a second later he made
a drop kick that sent the ball like a great bird sailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
majestically between the Deal goal posts. And the
score was 4 to 0 in favor of Boxford.</p>

<p>Pandemonium broke loose on the visitors’ side-lines,
while the home boys were still with apprehension
and disappointment. Soon the ball was back in the
center of the field in Deal’s possession, and was being
pushed, inevitably it appeared, toward Boxford’s goal,
and the strident cries of “Touchdown, touchdown,
touchdown!” rang across the campus from the throats
of three hundred Deal boys. “How much time?”
cried Sandy. “Three minutes to play!” called the
time-keeper, and his ominous words were taken up and
repeated by the referee. Tony felt as if his heart would
break. Why, why, why, he wondered, did not Drayton
give him a chance? And Jack Stenton, anxiously
pacing the side-lines, wondered too. And then suddenly
Tony heard Kid’s squeaky voice ring out,
“Sixteen, twenty-two, one,”&mdash;his signal! And bracing
nerves and sinews, he waited breathlessly as the
left half received the ball, and, dodging the arms of
the Boxford player who had broken through, thrust
the smooth little pigskin into Tony’s arms. Away
he dashed, with Chapin, Maclaren, and Thorndyke
interfering, round right end. He thrust his hand
into the shoulder of the opposing tackle, successfully
dodged a heavy Boxford boy who had dived to
tackle, and with Chapin by his side, went tearing
down the field, which was perfectly open save for
the frantic quarter-back of the Boxford team, who was
dashing forward to intercept him. Thirty yards
more and the game was won! but the quarter-back
was almost upon him. “Keep ahead! keep ahead!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>”
he screamed at Chapin, who seemed for the instant
to be lagging behind. Twenty yards!&mdash;and he could
see the Boxford quarter dashing diagonally across
the field toward him, and almost feel his arms pinioning
his legs. An instantaneous glance&mdash;yes, yes, he could
make it if Chapin would only keep up with him and
ward off that quarter as he made his lunge. Then,
just as the Deal boys rose to a man, with a frantic
cheer, the supreme moment was come. The line was
reached, but suddenly Deering felt a jolt; the quarter’s
arms were about his waist, as they went sprawling
toward the goal-line; but another arm clothed in a
<i>red</i> sweater had thrust itself next Tony’s body and
given the ball a terrific shove. In an agony of horror,
as he fell heavily to earth, he saw the football fall
out of his arms, bound to the ground in front of them,
and Chapin and the Boxford quarter lunge together,
as they all went down in the mêlée. But the Boxford
boy was on the ball and had scored a touchback!</p>

<p>There was a shrill whistle, and the crowd of players
were about them, the Deal boys uttering harsh cries
of anger and disappointment; the Boxford boys
cheering in delirious joy, and above it all a hoarse
voice screaming “Time! time!” Tony pulled himself
together. “What’s that?” he exclaimed in bewildered
fashion. “Deal this way,” yelled Sandy
Maclaren; and then to him in a contemptuous aside,
“The game’s over, you fool; get up and cheer.”</p>

<p>Suddenly he realized the whole situation, realized
much more than any one else did at that strenuous
moment, for he remembered the red-clothed arm that
was responsible for the catastrophe of his losing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
ball, and he gave a long look full into Chapin’s face,
but held his tongue. With a sudden overwhelming
bitterness he realized that Chapin had had his revenge.</p>

<p>As soon as the cheer was over he ran across the
field toward the Gymnasium, passing Jack Stenton
on the way, who gave him a glance of unmitigated
disgust. “Couldn’t you have kept from fumbling
for one second when the game was in your hands?”
he hissed at him, forgetting himself in his bitter disappointment.
Tony bent his head and ran on&mdash;not
back to the lockers, but to his own room in Standerland,
where he locked himself in. He refused to
open even to Jimmie Lawrence, who came knocking
there presently, loyal despite his grief, anxious only
to commiserate his friend, whom he knew was suffering
more keenly than any of the rest of them.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pch">AFTERMATH</p>

<p>The outcome of the game for several days cast a
deep gloom over the school. No one apparently had
seen Chapin’s dastardly play, so that the cause of the
defeat was very generally ascribed to Tony’s fumbling.
The Boxford boys had driven off in great glee, Deal
joining good-spiritedly in their cheers; but the bells
remained silent; the bon-fires were not lighted, and
the school settled down to a doleful Saturday night.
Little groups of boys gathered here and there after
supper, and discussed the incidents of the day. Sandy
Maclaren and Stenton were universally blamed for
having risked the experiment of playing a green boy
in a big game, but with boys’ native generosity they
showed no animosity toward Deering. He had lost
the game&mdash;the consciousness of that, they realized,
was bitter enough punishment for him. Even his
own form mates thought it natural that he should
prefer to keep to himself that evening, and showed
little sympathy for Jimmie Lawrence’s anxiety on his
behalf. Jimmie had tried again and again to get
into Tony’s room, but could get no response to his
repeated knockings.</p>

<p>Had he known all that was going on in Tony’s
mind and heart, he would have understood. For shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
in his bedroom, flat upon his face on the bed, Deering
was struggling with the keenest temptation he had
ever faced. He realized acutely the opprobrium, the
unjust opprobrium, that he would meet with, perhaps
not crediting his schoolmates for as much generosity
as they had; and though he would not have feared to
face the boys had the fault been his own, he could
not trust himself yet to meet them, see their disappointment
in him, receive their tolerant sympathy, when
he knew that a word from him might free himself
from ignominy and cast the blame where it belonged.
And as he lay there, great waves of hate for Chapin
swept over him. He clenched his fists and drove
them into the pillows, longing that his fingers were
about Chapin’s throat and that he might choke out
of him a confession of his dastardly betrayal. To his
overwrought mind his future in the school looked dark
and unattractive. The two months that he had spent
there had been so bright and happy; he had made such
warm friends and won for himself, it seemed, such a
promising place in the regard of the school; and now,
he felt, all must change, and his fool’s paradise go
tumbling down. To have been given his chance, and
failed through the willful meanness of another, and
failing, to have cost his school the victory! For a
moment he felt that he would pack his trunk, go down
and tell Stenton the truth, and then take the first
train out of Monday Port and leave the school to
settle the wrangle how it would.</p>

<p>And then he remembered his grandfather’s parting
words, as the old general had stood in the portico
of the white-pillar’d house on the far-away bayou,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
“Never repay a meanness by a meanness, my boy;
and you will make a good sort of Christian.” And
now, would not telling, truth though it were, be
repaying a meanness by a meanness? Yes; but with
the acknowledgment, wrung from his conscience, he
burst into tears, tears of helpless disappointment and
chagrin. Telling on another, especially in his own
defense, Tony had always instinctively felt the most
exquisite form of meanness.</p>

<p>After a time he slipped from the bed, and fell on his
knees by the bedside, obeying an unconscious need,
in response to the suggestion of an unbroken habit
of putting his boyish trust in an unseen power that
knew and understood. “Oh, God,” he cried, “don’t
let me be mean.” And after a time, though as a matter
of fact he prayed very little more while he knelt there,
he rose up, removed his soiled football clothes, washed
and dressed, and slipped out quietly upon the campus.
He avoided meeting the wandering boys, took himself
to the beach, and with wind whistling and waves roaring
in his ears, in tune with his mood, he walked the
four miles out to the extreme point of Strathsey Neck.
It was a grim walk, but not an unhappy one, for he
had won his battle and had definitely made up his
mind to be silent about the game as he had been
silent about the hazing.</p>

<p class="ptb1"><b>*********</b></p>

<p>But Tony was not the only person who had witnessed
the game that day and knew who in reality
was responsible for the defeat. Mr. Morris, who
chanced to be standing on the side near the Boxford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
goal-line, had seen with perfect distinctness all that
took place during that exciting moment of the game.
And though several of the boys standing near him had
exclaimed, “It looks as if Chapin had knocked the
ball out of Deering’s arms himself,” with his accustomed
reserve, he held his peace and made no comment.
The incredibility of such an act on Chapin’s part had
speedily driven from the boys’ minds the momentary
impression. Morris, observing at the time of the
game that Reggie Carroll was standing near him, had
moved over to join him. But at that instant time
had been called, and immediately the field was a scene
of indescribable confusion. The house master pondered
over the matter during the evening, but could not
make up his mind as to the proper course of action.</p>

<p>Just before lights that night he strolled into Carroll’s
and Deering’s study, where he found Reggie as usual
at his ease in a Morris chair with a novel in his hands.
Carroll affected French novels, largely because he
could plead the excuse when he was caught reading
them that it was for the sake of his languages.</p>

<p>“Come in, do, Mr. Morris,” exclaimed Carroll, with
a trace less than his wonted coolness. The master
entered, closing the door behind him. “Where is
Deering?” he asked, as he seated himself on the
couch, and taking up a paper-cutter from the table,
began to play with it.</p>

<p>“He has just come back from a long walk, and
turned in, sir. Would you like to speak with him?”</p>

<p>“No, no, thank you,” Morris answered. “But I
will sit for a moment, if you like, and talk with you.
That was an unfortunate game to-day, was it not?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>”
And as Morris asked the question he looked at Reggie
closely.</p>

<p>“Very,” the boy answered, laconically.</p>

<p>“Particularly for our friend Deering,” persisted the
master.</p>

<p>“Yes, I wish they had not played him; it was a poor
experiment.”</p>

<p>“Had you supposed him a careless player?”</p>

<p>Carroll looked up languidly, but there was a keen
glance in his eyes, and a note of significance in his
voice, as he answered, “No, sir, I don’t think him
a careless player, Mr. Morris.”</p>

<p>“And yet he fumbled at a most inopportune time,”
suggested Morris, musingly.</p>

<p>Carroll flung his book a little impatiently on the
table, and looked the older man frankly in the eyes.
“Mr. Morris,” he exclaimed, with every trace of
indifference gone, “I am going to tell you in strict
confidence what I know about the game. It is scarcely
a decent thing for me to tell it, but then I saw it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” Morris murmured, encouragingly.</p>

<p>“I saw Arthur Chapin knock the ball out of Tony’s
arms just as they crossed the line and the Boxford
quarter tackled him. I believe he did it on purpose.
Now, I know,” he went on quickly, “that it is a terrible
accusation to make against a fellow even in confidence
to you; but that’s what happened, and I don’t know
what I ought to do about it. It’s incredible, but I saw
it.” And springing from his chair, Reggie began to
pace excitedly up and down the room.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Morris, quietly, “it is incredible,
but I saw it too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Reggie. “You saw it, Mr.
Morris?”</p>

<p>“Yes, just as you describe it. It is due to the fact
that I supposed you also had seen it that I came in to
talk it over with you to-night. I am afraid Chapin
is capable of that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“Well, then&mdash;&mdash;”&mdash;Reggie stopped&mdash;”Well, then,”
he repeated, “I suppose it is up to us to tell the Head.”</p>

<p>Morris appeared to be lost in thought. “Of course,”
he said, after a moment, “that is the right course to
think of; but I am not sure, my dear fellow, that I
think it best for us to do that just yet. I want to wait
a bit, I think, and see what Deering might wish us to
do. You can be sure he knows it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I am sure he knows,&mdash;he couldn’t help
knowing.”</p>

<p>“Well, personally I can’t see what good will come
by going to the Head right away. I am quite sure
that if it is brought officially to Dr. Forester’s notice
that he will feel obliged to make it known to the
school, both as a punishment to Chapin and in justice
to Deering.”</p>

<p>“But ought that not to be done?” asked Carroll.</p>

<p>“Well, in one sense, yes; but do you know, Reggie,&mdash;though
it may seem unwise in me, I have an extraordinary
faith in Deering’s judgment about this matter.
I want to know how he takes it before we do
anything.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think <i>he will</i> want us to do anything. But,
sir, think of what his not telling will mean to him;
think of the way the school will treat him for a while!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but only for a while. There are possibilities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
in the situation, Reginald, that I think we were wiser
not to spoil by acting upon snap judgments.”</p>

<p>Carroll reflected. “Right, O wise man!” he exclaimed
in a moment. “Shall we sound Tony, then?”</p>

<p>“Rather not, I should say. Let us see the line
that Tony takes himself. A few days will not make
any difference, and we can set things straight, you
know.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Morris, the school is going to lose the
credit of victory.”</p>

<p>“Ah! it must do that in any case. <i>One</i> of our men
fumbled, you know, whether accidentally or not; it
makes no difference in the result of the game:&mdash;Boxford
won. What’s really at stake, my boy, is the
character of those two fellows, and that’s everything&mdash;<i>everything</i>,
Reggie!”</p>

<p>“By Jove, Mr. Morris,” exclaimed the boy impetuously,
“if anyone will ever make me believe that,
you and Deering will.” And he shook the master’s
hand more heartily than he had ever done before.</p>

<p>Deering appeared the next day at his usual place in
school, and faced the ordeal bravely enough. It was
an ordeal despite a general effort on the part of a
majority of the boys to avoid discussion of the game
in his presence. Here and there, to be sure, he met
with the veiled glance of contempt or unfriendliness.
Hardest of all, however, he found it to receive Sandy
Maclaren’s and Mr. Stenton’s kindly sympathy. The
Great Sandy, as the boys affectionately called him,
from his pinnacle as the Head of the School, was a
hero to Tony. Sandy’s confidence and friendliness
had been one of the chief factors in what he regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
as his success. The friendliness was still there, but
Tony sadly feared the confidence was shattered.</p>

<p>Stenton took him by the arm as the boys were pouring
out of morning Chapel the next day, where they
had heard a sermon in which the Doctor had obviously
taken his illustrations from the defeat of the day before.
Stenton drew Tony along with him toward the Old
School.</p>

<p>“I want to apologize to you, Deering,” he began,
“for the way I spoke to you yesterday afternoon. I
was horribly upset by the unexpectedness of things,
and simply lost my temper. I know you did your
best, and I know too that no one is proof against accident
in football or anything else.”</p>

<p>Tony bit his lip and set his teeth. “Thanks,
Mr. Stenton,” he said briefly. “I appreciate your
speaking to me in this way.”</p>

<p>“It was poor interference, anyway,” went on the
master, “Chapin might have saved the day if he
had been a bit faster. He had no wind yesterday.”</p>

<p>Tony kept silent, and there was an awkward pause
in the conversation, during which they came to the
steps of the Old School. “Well,” said Stenton, turning
off, “I only wanted to tell you that I am sorry I spoke
irritably. I want you to have your chance next year
again, and show that you are the player I think you
are.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much, Mr. Stenton,” said Tony
again, and turned away.</p>

<p>That night after Chapel Tony had his first talk with
Carroll since the game. It was desultory enough,
until Reggie spoke out frankly and expressed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
sympathy. Then Deering was immediately alert,
his face flushed quickly, and he spoke with rather a
tone of irritation. “Don’t let’s talk about the game,
Reggie. It was a bad business, and I have made up
my mind that the less said about it the better. Matters
can’t be changed, and all I can hope to do is to make
good next year. Stenton has as much as promised
that I shall have the chance. I want to forget yesterday’s
game as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>“Right!” said Carroll. “I promise you, you shall
hear no more of it from me.”</p>

<p>A little later, after Tony had gone to bed, Carroll
went in to see Mr. Morris, and repeated the substance
of this conversation.</p>

<p>“It’s as I thought,” he said in conclusion, “we shall
hear no more of it from Tony. Do you still think,
sir, that we should hold our tongues?”</p>

<p>“For the present, yes,” answered Morris. “If you
don’t mind, Reggie, I want to manage this myself.
In the course of time, I shall see Chapin, if he takes
no action to clear Deering. It will be infinitely better
if he confesses of his own accord. The truth will be
known some time, and in the meanwhile I don’t think
Deering will really suffer in popular estimation. The
boys like him, and they will forgive what they think is
his carelessness. If the confession comes from Chapin
both boys will get some good out of it. I feel sure that
the Doctor would approve of this, though I feel equally
sure that if the matter were brought to his attention now
he would feel obliged to act as Head Master at once.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir: I shall say no more about it,
until you give me leave.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Morris was right. Tony did not suffer very greatly,
and in the course of a few weeks the game was practically
forgotten. Chapin certainly showed no inclination
to right the wrong he had done, and for the
time being, Morris was content to let matters drift.</p>

<p>Within a month the school broke up for the three
weeks’ Christmas recess. Tony did not make the
long trip south for a visit home, but instead went
with Jimmie to the Lawrences’ country-place on
Long Island, where the boys spent a happy holiday,
riding and shooting, and being plied with good things
by Jimmie’s indulgent parents. Tony made a good
impression on Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence, and this visit
to his friend’s home, served to deepen and strengthen
the happy intimacy between the two boys. Early in
January they were back at Deal for the long winter
term, which Tony was promised would be exceedingly
dull. He rather welcomed the relief from football
practice, however, and sensibly made up his mind
to make the term count in his form work. For so
far, Tony’s reputation as a scholar had scarcely kept
pace with his popularity as a genial companion and
a good athlete.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pch">LOVEL’S WOODS</p>

<p>“Ough, school again!” exclaimed Jimmie Lawrence,
with a grunt, as he jumped off the platform of the
little way-train at Monday Port one bright cold
afternoon the following January. “I say, Tony,”
he continued, linking his arm in that of his companion,
and fishing in his pockets with his disengaged hand
for his luggage checks, “this term it is school and no
mistake! An unspeakable odor of gumshoe pervades
the premises; Pussie Gray hurls math. lessons at your
head a yard long, and the masters generally shriek
exhortations at you as though you were deaf as well
as dumb.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Jimmo! I am right glad to get back.”
And Tony drew in a deep breath of the cold pure air,
and his eyes glistened as he looked out across the
snow-clad landscape&mdash;the white town clinging to its
hills, the frozen pond, the troubled blue waters of
the bay. “I’ve never seen any snow to speak of, you
know; think of the sliding down Deal Hill! Mind,
old boy, we’re to pack over to Lovel’s Woods this
afternoon and see to a cave.”</p>

<p>“Gemini crickets! Deering, you’ll get enough of
the Woods before the winter’s over. Me for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
form-room and a heart to heart talk with my loving
schoolmates.”</p>

<p>“Be an old woman if you like,” interrupted Kit
Wilson, who joined them at this moment. “Tony
and I will find the cave, and you’ve got to pony up
the first supply of grub.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” said Jimmie, with a grand air,
as the three boys climbed into a fly. “If you will
direct the coachman of this equipage to stop at the
Pie-house, I will give Mrs. Wadmer a <i>carte blanche</i>
order for the proper supplies; and we’ll have a feed
to-morrow afternoon. At present, I’m perished with
cold.”</p>

<p>By this time the driver had applied the whip to
his poor horse, and the dilapidated fly was crawling
up the cobblestones of Montgomery street. Once
the top of the hill was gained, it moved along more
rapidly, and soon Monday Port was left behind, the
icy shores of Deal Water had been skirted, and
the long hill that led up to the school was being
climbed. The school “barge,” filled with a shouting,
laughing crowd of small boys, was lumbering along
ahead of them, and a dozen or so more cabs such as
our friends had chartered dotted the white road.
They passed a few of these, and noisy greetings were
exchanged.</p>

<p>“There’s a trifling pleasure in seeing the kids once
more,” said Jimmie, settling back after they had
passed the barge, and assuming a <i>blasé</i> expression.
“It would be rather jolly to be a prefect and boss
‘em all about.... Whoa-up! here’s the Pie-house
and there’s Mother Wadmer in the doorway with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
a smile of welcome as broad as her pocketbook is
deep. Hello, Mrs. Wadmer,” he cried, as the cab
drew up before a small frame house by the roadside,
on the portico of which stood a tall angular Cæsarean
dame, with a calico apron drawn over her head.</p>

<p>“How de do, Master Lawrence; howdy, boys.
Come right in, and I’ll give you a glass of the best
cider you’ve ever tasted. ‘Tis Mister Wadmer’s own
brew, and a fine thing to begin the term on.”</p>

<p>The three boys piled out of the fly, and in a moment
were merrily greeting the crowd of youngsters who
already had established themselves about the long deal
table in Mrs. Wadmer’s hospitable kitchen. “Hello,
Jim!” “Hello, Kit!” “Hello, Tony,” and a dozen other
names, nicknames or parts of names, rang out. The
boys shook hands, exchanged rapid notes of vacation
experiences, gulped down several glasses of cider,
and consumed a score or so of luscious tarts.</p>

<p>“When did you get back, Tack?” Kit enquired of
a large, ungainly, rosy-cheeked boy who came from
Maine.</p>

<p>“This morning,” answered Turner. “I came down
on the boat last night to New York&mdash;scrumptious
time. Say, Kit, have you heard the latest at school?”</p>

<p>“No, we just got in, crawled across the flats from
Coventry. What’s up?”</p>

<p>“What’s up? why, some meddlesome jackanapes
in the Sixth got wise to something irregular last
winter and has gone to the Doctor with a doleful
tale about the wickedness that’s supposed to go on
in the Woods; so the fiat has gone forth: no caves for
boys below the Fourth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“No caves!” shouted a dozen boys. A storm of
protests and exclamations arose. “Well,” said Jimmie,
as the hubbub ceased, “school will be a jolly old
jumping-off place then.”</p>

<p>“No caves for boys below the Fourth,” echoed
Kit. “Well, I announce my promotion then. Come
on, Tony; come on, Jim; let’s get up to school and
get the facts.”</p>

<p>They stalked out amidst howls of derision, and
re-entered their chariot. Jimmie had taken care,
however, to direct Mrs. Wadmer to stack it well with
such provisions as were in customary requisition in
Lovel’s Woods. The worthy landlady of the Pie-house
was officially deaf to all rules that emanated
from the Head unless they were presented to her in
writing. She owed, it may be said in parenthesis,
her long career under the shadow of Deal School to
the admirable loyalty of many generations of Deal
boys.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, to Tony’s amusement as he
watched Jimmie’s expression, the first person they
met in the Old School whither they went at once to
report, was Mr. Roylston, who held a roll-call in his
hands and wore on his face a look of patient suffering
and in his eyes an expression of latent indignation.
Our friends, thanks to their digression at the Pie-house,
were ten minutes late.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mr. Roylston?” exclaimed Kit,
offering his hand, and receiving three of the master’s
lifeless fingers. A pencil occupied the other two.
“Ah!” he murmured,&mdash;Kit afterwards declared, with
satisfaction,&mdash;“Lawrence, Wilson, Deering&mdash;ten minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
late. I congratulate you on the punctual way in
which you begin the new year.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, we were beguiled by the way,” protested
the irrepressible Kit. “The woman beguiled me, sir,
and I did eat.”</p>

<p>“Faugh!” exclaimed Mr. Roylston. “Spare me
your coarse irreverence. You are redolent of the
unpleasant odors of the Pie-house. I will give you
five marks apiece.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir!”</p>

<p>“Please, sir!”</p>

<p>“I beg of you, sir. Pray divide ‘em, sir.”</p>

<p>“Silence, Wilson; you are impertinent as well as
irreverent. If you linger longer with this futile protesting,
I shall double your marks. Kindly go at
once and unpack your trunks.”</p>

<p>“Please, sir; we always do that in the evening, sir;
and I hope you will allow us to go to the form-room,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Don’t ‘sir’ me so. Write out for me before to-morrow’s
school fifty lines of the Æneid, and go at
once.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir!” And lest they all get a similar
dose of “pensum,” as such punishments were called,
they hurried off to the Third Form common-room.
There they found a crowd of newly-arrived boys,
engaged in a vociferous denunciation of the Doctor’s
new rule against caves in the Woods. The news had
evidently been announced by the prefects.</p>

<p>“What a gloomy old piece of rubber the Gumshoe
is!” muttered Kit, as they were entering. “Fancy
soaking me a pensum two minutes after I’m back at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
school. Hey, you fellows!” he cried, “what’s this
racket?”</p>

<p>A dozen boys started to explain together, so that
from their noisy chatter nothing could be gathered,
except “Woods,” “caves” and execrations on the
Head and the Sixth, with Kit’s lament on the gloomy
Mr. Roylston rising above it all like a dismal
howl.</p>

<p>A Fourth Form boy,&mdash;Barney Clayton, by name,&mdash;thrust
a red head through the open doorway. “Oh,
fy!” he yelled, “what a precious howl you kids are
letting out! What’s the matter? does the prohibition
against caves rile your independent spirits?”</p>

<p>“Get out, you red-head!” rose in angry chorus;
and one boy shied a dog-eared Latin book at the
fiery shock in the doorway. In a second a shower of
missiles,&mdash;ink-stands, books, chairs, waste-paper basket,&mdash;went
flying through the doorway and out into
the corridor. Barney ducked his head and fled,
shouting back derisive taunts. The commotion attracted
the attention of Mr. Roylston at his post
in the main hall, and he came flying to quell the
disturbance. And, alas! he arrived just at a moment
to receive full in the face the contents of a waste-paper
basket, which Kit had flung. The débris descended
upon him in comical fashion. The poor
gentleman was speechless with indignation; but the
situation was too much for the boys; despite his angry
countenance, his blazing black eyes, they greeted
his appearance with shouts of laughter.</p>

<p>He waited, inarticulate with rage, until the commotion
ceased, finally quelling them to a spell-bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
silence by the sheer force of his anger, and a little
also, by the righteousness of his cause.</p>

<p>“In the whole course of my career as a schoolmaster,”
the master said at last, with a nervous jerk to each
phrase, but pronouncing each word with the deadly
precision of a judge uttering a capital sentence, “I
have never been met with such gratuitous insult.
Every member of this form will consider himself on
bounds until further notice. As for you, Wilson, you
shall be reported immediately to the Head, and if my
recommendation can effect it, you will receive the
caning you deserve.”</p>

<p>“We were not throwing at you&mdash;we didn’t know
you were coming&mdash;” began Kit.</p>

<p>“Silence! do not add hypocrisy to insolence. You
had been told to go to your rooms.... Disperse
now at once, and do not show yourselves before supper.
You Wilson, Lawrence and Deering, remain behind
and clean up this disgusting mess. It is not surprising,
I may say, that the Head feels himself unable to
trust this form in the Woods this winter.” And with
this parting shot, Mr. Roylston turned and walked
away, with what dignity he could command.</p>

<p>The boys, somewhat subdued by the dispiriting
announcement of bounds, marched off gloomily, and
our three friends stayed behind and began to clear
up the débris.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Kit at last, turning a half-merry, half-rueful
countenance to his companions, as he seated
himself upon a broken chair, “what a gloomy ass it is!
But, oh my dears, did you observe his beautiful pea-green,
Nile blue, ultramarine phiz as the contents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of the waste-basket descended upon his lean and
hairless chops? Oh, my! what a home-coming! what
a sweet heart to heart talk we’ve all had together!”</p>

<p>“And a jolly good caning you’ll get, Kitty, when
Gumshoe has had his talk with the Doctor.”</p>

<p>“Jolly good,” replied Kit, rubbing his legs with
a wry face. “But in the meantime, mes enfants,”
he continued, “since I am to be swished, it shall not
be that I suffer unjustly; we are going to make the
swishing worth while. We are off to the Woods this
minute. We’ll take the stuff over, stow it in the cave,
put up a notice, and be back by supper. I’ll be hanged
if I’ll pay any attention to Gumshoe’s twaddle about
bounds or to the Doctor’s nonsense about caves.
Are you with me, Jimmie, old boy?”</p>

<p>“Well, rather,” Jimmie replied. “The experience
of the last quarter of an hour has quite discouraged
me with regard to the peace and quiet and healthy
conversation us nice boys ought to have in form
common-room.”</p>

<p>Tony had kept silent. “Well, are you going to cut
for a quitter?” asked Kit, turning upon him with an
indignant glare.</p>

<p>“Not I,” said Tony quickly.</p>

<p>“Then help stow this truck. We’ve an hour and
a half till supper, and the Gumshoe will undoubtedly
think we have <i>disperrssed</i> to our rooms.” And he
gave an absurd imitation of Mr. Roylston’s manner
of speaking.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later they were running down the
slope of Deal Hill, under the cover of the stone walls;
then tearing across the frozen marshes, and clambering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
up the steep banks and crags that bounded the west
side of Lovel’s Woods. The sun was sinking in the
west, and its rich mellow golden light fell athwart
the snow-clad woodland, flooding it with glory, save
where the great masses of pine and cedar cast broad
splotches of shadow. The splendid loveliness of the
dying afternoon, the biting cold of the wind, the thrill
of doing the forbidden, filled Tony with a delicious
sense of happiness and adventure.</p>

<p>Each boy had his arms full of cooking utensils,
food, boxes&mdash;the varied paraphernalia of a cave.
It had been an ancient custom at Deal during the
winter for boys to have caves in Lovel’s Woods,
where they cooked weird messes during the afternoons
when there was no skating. This year the Doctor,
owing to certain abuses reported by the prefects the
year before, had decided to restrict the use of caves
to the three upper forms.</p>

<p>Kit had a particular cave in mind, far away on the
remote side of what was known as the Third Ridge,
a cave that he and Jimmie and Teddy Lansing had
had together the year before as Second Formers. This
desirable spot was a natural formation in the rocky
side of the farther of the three ridges of which Lovel’s
Woods consisted. It was practically inaccessible from
below, and the entrance above, well concealed by a
clump of low cedars, was a narrow cleft in the rocks,
at the extreme edge of which the initiated might
descend to the cave by a series of dangerous steps
which the boys had fashioned in the side of the precipitous
cliff.</p>

<p>Tony and Kit climbed down into the cave, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Jimmie, lying flat on the ledge above, handed down
to them the supply of stores. These were safely
stowed in a strong box, which had lasted out the
previous season, and made secure. When the boys
had clambered up again, they discovered that the
sun had set and the darkness was gathering swiftly.
The clear crescent of the new moon hung in the western
sky a band of gold, and the evening star was rising
over the ocean.</p>

<p>“Twenty minutes to supper: we can just make it,”
exclaimed Kit, looking at his watch. “Heave ahead,
my hearties, and let’s run for it.”</p>

<p>And run they did, at breakneck speed along the
mazy paths, through the tangled undergrowth, over
the slippery crags, across the frozen marsh. Kit,
the imprudent, was impudently singing at the top
of his shrill voice the verses of one of the School
songs.</p>

<p class="pphq8 p1">“Out of the briny east,<br />
Out of the frosty north,</p>
<p class="pphq8">Over the school-topp’d hill,<br />
Whistle the shrill winds forth.</p>

<p class="pphq8 p1">“Over the waves a-quiver,<br />
Over the salt sedge grass,</p>
<p class="pphq8">Over the beaches tawny,<br />
The bright wind spirits pass.”</p>

<p class="p1">And the other two boys took up the ringing refrain,</p>

<p class="pphq8 p1">“Grapple them e’er they go,<br />
Grapple them e’er they go.”</p>

<p class="p1">Luck was with them. They reached the school
as the great bell in the Chapel struck six. Five minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
later, after a hasty wash and brush-up in their
rooms, they were in the great library, shaking hands
with the Doctor and Mrs. Forester and with masters
and boys.</p>

<p>The three, more closely united than ever by their
sense of sharing a dangerous secret, kept together
during chapel, and directly after were for making
off to Jimmie’s room, when Sandy Maclaren, looking
wonderfully handsome and “swagger” in his town
clothes, laid a heavy hand on Kit’s shoulder. “Not
so fast, boy. The Doctor wants to see you instanter
at the Rectory.”</p>

<p>Kit heaved a sigh in mock heroics. “Hail, blithe
spirits,” he lamented, murdering his quotation, “hail
and farewell.”</p>

<p>The boys pressed his hands heartily. “Is it a
caning, Sandy?” they asked.</p>

<p>“Well, I rather think so,” answered Maclaren,
with a smile. “You weren’t very keen not to distinguish
between Barney Clayton and Mr. Roylston.”</p>

<p>“They were both butting in,” protested Kit.</p>

<p>“Well, cut along now. And you two report to Bill,
he’s looking for you.”</p>

<p>Kit found the Doctor in his comfortable study at
the Rectory, standing before a glowing log fire, with
his swallow-tails spread to the blaze.</p>

<p>“Ah, Christopher,” the Head Master exclaimed,
shaking hands with the culprit, “I’m glad to see you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. Maclaren said you wanted to
see me particularly?”</p>

<p>“I do, most particularly. Take off your coat.”</p>

<p>Kit backed a little. “But, sir&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, my boy, I dare say you have full and ample
explanations, but I am quite sure they will not impress
me. I know that you were but one of many in this
fracas, and that it is your misfortune&mdash;shall I say?&mdash;rather
than your fault that your particular missile
took unfortunate effect. But we must all suffer at
times for our mistakes, perhaps a little unjustly. The
moment has struck when you must suffer too. The
sooner we get at this business the sooner it will be
over.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” said Kit, and silently removed
his coat. And then the Doctor took a familiar implement
of stout old hickory from a corner, and
swished him soundly. Those were the happy days
when debts against school discipline were so quickly
and effectively liquidated.</p>

<p>Kit bore no grudge to the Doctor, and comparatively
little to Mr. Roylston. “It was worth it,”
he confessed to Jimmie and Tony afterwards, “and
I rather think this lets me out, conscientiously lets
me out, you know, from paying attention to his futile
announcement of bounds.”</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the Doctor’s prohibition
against Lovel’s Woods was about as unpopular a rule
as had ever been promulgated. Combined with the
fact that the Third Form were bounded for a month,
as a consequence of their trouble with Mr. Roylston,
the Lower School began the term in a bad mood. The
Third Formers were particularly disgruntled with the
prefects, who had assumed the responsibility of keeping
Lovel’s Woods in order. It appeared that smoking
had been indulged in the year before quite extensively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
by some of the younger boys, and gambling was
suspected on the part of a few of the older ones. The
Doctor’s rule had been more in the nature of a preventive
than a punishment.</p>

<p>But the effort to keep the rule effective was more
of an undertaking than the prefects had realized;
for they felt themselves required practically to police
the forbidden district, a task, the novelty of which
soon wore off. With the older boys caves were not
particularly popular. Chapin and Marsh started one
together, and moved into it the paraphernalia that
they had hitherto kept stored in the cave on the
beach by Beaver Creek. All of the prefects, acting
on Maclaren’s advice, gave up their caves in order
to set an example; with the result that there were
hardly more than a dozen in official operation.</p>

<p>For the first few weeks of the term the prefects
were so zealous in their police duties that few boys
cared to run the risk of “skipping” to the Woods.
Even our three friends, despite their firm resolution
to evade the rule, for the time being felt it the part
of wisdom to lie low. Accordingly they avoided the
Woods as if it were plague stricken and industriously
played hockey every afternoon on Deal Great Pond,
which was fully two miles away. But toward the end
of January a thaw set in, the skating was spoiled,
a heavy snow came, and their usual sports were interrupted;
consequently the temptation to visit the cave
<i>sub rosa</i> grew stronger than ever. Gradually also the
inclement weather dampened the ardor of the prefects
and they began to relax their vigilance over the
forbidden territory. And we may say in passing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Tony and Jimmie and Kit spent several delightful
afternoons in their hiding-place, and the parts of one
or two wildly thrilling nights after lights.</p>

<p>Despite his nefarious proceedings in contravention
of the rules, be it said to his credit, Tony was making
good his resolution of “poling” at his books, and felt
confident of taking a good stand in the school when
the ranks were read at the beginning of February.
The football game, so far as his part in it was concerned,
as Morris had predicted, seemed forgotten.
He avoided Chapin as much as he could, and when
they inevitably met he treated him with a courteous
indifference which the older boy doubtless understood
and was thankful to accept.</p>

<p>Carroll, after a vacation spent in New York where
he had seen all of the plays and dined at the best
restaurants and gone to many more dances than were
good for his health, returned to the school more than
ever dissatisfied and disgruntled with the life he led
in it. The talk with Mr. Morris about Tony, the
consciousness that they possessed an important secret
in common, served a little to make his relations with
his house master easier, but he was still unable to
give his friendship in the easy way he longed to give
it. Neither, to his deepening chagrin and regret, was
he making progress in his friendship with Deering,
for Tony was more than ever absorbed in the life of
his form, and spent all his free time with Wilson and
Lawrence. He seemed unconscious of the affection
he had won from Carroll and this, with Carroll’s
intense consciousness of how completely his affection
was going out, served to make their relations anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
but free and spontaneous. So far as Tony thought
about his room-mate that term it was as of an older
fellow with whom he was not very congenial, and of
whose laziness and indifferent attitude toward the
school he did not approve. He thought Carroll to
be wasting his time both at his books and in the
school life, in either of which he could have counted immensely.
Had Tony been less absorbed in his younger
friends, he would probably have found a good deal in
Reggie to like and value, as earlier in the year he had
begun to feel he should.</p>

<p>From his cozy den in the midst of Standerland Hall,
surrounded by his well-loved books, his few but
carefully chosen pictures, Mr. Morris watched the
life throbbing about him with sympathetic insight
and keen interest. He was not one of those fortunate
schoolmasters who do not allow their profession to
engage their affections. Morris, with a surrender
that was effectually a sacrifice, for he had gifts and
opportunities that might have won him a finer place
in the world, gave his life completely to the school.
He had loved it as a boy, he had looked back upon it
during college with fond recollection and yearning,
and after three years or so at a professional school,
having taken his examinations for the bar, he had
gone back to accept Dr. Forester’s offer of a mastership.
For half-a-dozen years he had been there now,
and each year the place and the boys got a deeper
hold upon his heart and his interest. He was scrupulously
fair and evenly kind; therefore deservedly
popular; but despite this he had his favorite boys, not
usually known as such by the school at large, to whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
he gave a special affection and a deeper interest.
From the first day, when Deering, with his sparkling
eyes and bright, clear-cut, eager face, had come to
him for a seat in the schoolroom, he had felt for him
that keen attraction which, as he grew to know the
boy’s high spirits, lively sense of honor, and sunshiny
nature, had deepened to a real affection. In Carroll
also he had always felt a special interest, and had been
glad when Tony was put to room with him. He
saw Reggie’s growing devotion to Deering, and was
sorry that Tony did not respond to a greater extent.
Morris felt that Carroll needed the strengthening
influence of a strong unselfish friendship with the
right sort of boy to help make a man of him. Occasionally
Morris had the two boys with others in his rooms
for tea or on Saturday nights for a rarebit and a bit
of supper, but otherwise occasions did not present
themselves for his getting to know them better. He
was sorry for this, but saw no very satisfactory way
of making them. By the end of January it seemed
to him that Reggie was in quite the worst attitude
that he had ever been, thoroughly indifferent to the
work and life of the school.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pch">A MIDNIGHT LARK</p>

<p>That winter proved to be a hard one, with frequent
snows and violent winds, which put an end to the
skating within a few weeks after Christmas, and left
the majority of the boys with no very satisfactory
pastime in the free afternoons. There was sliding
down Deal Hill a good part of the time, and to Tony,
who never before had experienced the pleasures of a
northern winter, this was great fun; but after a time
it palled upon his two cronies, Jimmie and Kit, and
at their suggestion surreptitious visits to the cave in
Lovel’s Woods became more frequent. Perhaps that
this was a forbidden pleasure added a keener zest
than they otherwise would have taken in it, and that
several boys had recently been caught in the Woods
and punished severely gave an element of danger to
their visits that made them even more fascinating.
Aside from the disobedience that these visits involved,
they were innocent enough. The boys, having reported
at call-over for a walk, would skirt the beaches
and enter the Woods from the east, completely out
of range of the school and comparatively safe from
detection unless they chanced to encounter prefects
or masters walking in the Woods themselves. The
indefatigable Mr. Gray often bent his steps in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
direction, but to the school’s intense delight, without
noticeable result. The snows were so heavy and the
walking consequently so difficult that the vigilance
of masters and prefects at last completely relaxed.
From that time on the boys who cared for the trouble
had a fairly clear field. Our friends were fortunate
in having a cave on the extreme eastern edge of the
woods, so that the approach from the beach was easy.
Once this was gained, they made a fire, cooked sausages,
fried pan-cakes of an extremely leathery quality, and
made coffee that certainly they would not have drunk
in any other place.</p>

<p>Tony had told Carroll of their exploits, and had even
invited him to pay them a visit and partake of their
“feed,” an invitation that was decisively declined.
“It is certainly not worth while,” he replied, with a
smile, “to run the risk of getting the Doctor quite
sour on me for the pleasure of partaking of the results
of your culinary skill.”</p>

<p>“A great deal better for you,” Tony retorted, “than
moping in doors half the time over sickly French
novels.”</p>

<p>“Possibly; but French novels are not the only
alternative to the Woods,” Reggie answered, “and
as a matter of fact I have begun to go in for tremendous
tramps.”</p>

<p>“You must take ‘em mostly at night, then.”</p>

<p>“I do frequently,” was the somewhat tart reply,
“the night air has always had a fascination for
me.”</p>

<p>In truth Tony was aware that Reggie had resumed
his old custom of disappearing from their rooms after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
lights, paying visits, he incuriously supposed, upon
some of his friends. The fact gave him little
thought.</p>

<p>One afternoon the three boys were in their cave.
Tony was turning pan-cakes in a skillet, while Jimmie
was laboring with a dark mixture that they euphemistically
called coffee. Kit sat on the branch of a
tree, with his head over the ledge, on the look-out
for any wandering prefects.</p>

<p>“Hurry up, you frabjous duffers,” he called down,
midst a stream of amiable chaffing; “it’s close upon
four, and we’ll have to bolt the grub in order to get
back to Gumshoe’s five o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you get down and work a bit, then?
Nobody’s coming along this late. Get the plates out,
and pour some syrup out of the jug. No work: no
eat.”</p>

<p>“Too many cooks spoil the broth,” he laughed....
“Shish!” he exclaimed suddenly, and ducked his head
below the ledge.</p>

<p>The three kept a tense silence for a moment. They
heard footsteps crunching in the snow above and
passing on. Kit cautiously peeped over the ledge.
“By Jove,” he whispered, “it’s Reggie Carroll and
Arty Chapin. I thought it was a couple of prefects.”</p>

<p>He slid down from the tree, and began to gobble
up one of Tony’s pan-cakes. “By the by, Tony, I
thought the elegant Reginald Carter Westover Carroll
had severed his friendship with that specimen of
common Chapin clay.”</p>

<p>“So he had,” answered Tony, musingly. “I didn’t
know they had taken up with each other again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“What a queer duck Reggie is,” said Jimmie, as
he poured out three cups of coffee. “Have you ever
made him out, Tony?”</p>

<p>“Not I. We hit it off well enough after the first
few days&mdash;for a time. But this term I have hardly
seen anything of him. I am sorry he is in with Chapin
again.”</p>

<p>“And I. I’ve always liked Reggie despite his
supercilious disdain, but Arty’s a beast, and always
was,” said Kit, drinking his coffee at a gulp. “Here,
let’s stow these things, and cut around to the north
and take a peep as to what that precious pair are up to.
Evidently no five o’clock for them.”</p>

<p>“What’s the difference where they are going?”
said Tony. “I have no mind to spy on them.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have a consuming curiosity,” Kit rejoined.
“They’re up to mischief, I’ll be bound.”</p>

<p>“Light out then,” said Tony, “for Jim and I are
going back over the ridges.”</p>

<p>“And leave your precious footprints in the snow,”
protested Kit. “La! la! stow the stuff, will you then?
I’ll report if there’s anything doing.”</p>

<p>And despite his companions’ adjurations Kit clambered
off over the rocks and started out in the direction
indicated by Carroll’s and Chapin’s footsteps in the
snow.</p>

<p>The boys got safely back without being detected,
but Kit was a quarter of an hour late, and created a
sad disturbance when he entered in the midst of
Mr. Roylston’s Third Latin recitation.</p>

<p>“The incorrigible Wilson,” remarked Mr. Roylston,
without turning his beady black eyes in his direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
“will kindly take a pensum of one hundred lines for
being late and disturbing the class.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir,” said Kit.</p>

<p>“Spare me your comments, pray. Continue your
recitation, Turner; Book Four, Chapter Fourteen,
line twenty. Proceed. Cæsar&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir.... Qui omnibus rebus subito
perterriti&mdash;” Tack spelled it out painfully, and fell
mercilessly upon it, “Who to all quickly having been
thoroughly terrified. Et celeritati nostri et discessu
suorum.... And with quickness to us both a
descent....”</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston transfixed the floundering youth
with a withering glance, and there was a moment of
awful silence. “With quickness to you, I may suggest,
Turner,” he said at last in scathing tones, “descent
into your seat and a zero in my mark-book.”</p>

<p>He turned to Kit. “Wilson, let us see if you can
cast light upon the darkness into which Turner has
led us.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I can’t, sir.”</p>

<p>“No?” murmured the master. “Well, I was not
hopeful,” and he quietly recorded a zero in his mark-book.
“Now, Deering&mdash;”</p>

<p>Tony took up the passage, and got through it
correctly enough, but not without being harassed by
Mr. Roylston’s interruptions and glances of incredulity
at his rendering of the Latin. The Latin recitations
at Deal under the famous Ebenezer Roylston&mdash;he
was the editor of an edition of Cicero that was
classic in its day&mdash;were periods of agony and boredom.
But at last this particular recitation came to an end,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and immediately afterward, Kit threw his arms about
the necks of his two friends, and drew them into a
vacant classroom.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“What’s up?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you frabjous kiddos! I tracked ‘em for a
mile&mdash;’twas a mucker trick, I’ll admit, but I’ve got it
in for Chapin. And what do you think, those two
blooming jays are playing poker with their crowd in
a shanty back of the Third Ridge. If it weren’t for
Reggie, I swear I’d peach on Chapin.”</p>

<p>“I swear you’d do nothing of the sort,” said Tony.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps not,” assented Kit, temporarily
crestfallen. “But I must say that’s a crummy thing
of them to do. Fine school spirit, eh!”</p>

<p>“Well, we have been skipping bounds pretty
regularly this fall, if I remember correctly.”</p>

<p>“My dear child,” remarked Kit paternally, “when
will you learn wisdom? The Doctor carefully distinguishes
between moral offenses and offenses against
school discipline. Now, bounds are obviously disciplinary
and not moral; hence we are mere wandering
angels, while those poker fiends are equally hence of
the lower regions.”</p>

<p>“Rot!” was the courteous rejoinder. “It is obvious
to any but a bonehead like yourself that the Doctor
imposed bounds this year for moral reasons, because
he had wind that just that sort of thing was going on.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” resumed Kit sarcastically. “I perceive the
glimmerings of a conscience. You are getting the
remorse for your own sins?”</p>

<p>“Not particularly. I am only objecting to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
complacent way in which you shove Carroll and
Chapin outside the pale of decency.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m easy, old boy; I certainly won’t be
damned for making pan-cakes in Lovel’s Woods; but
I can readily see that Reggie might for playing poker
there. But it isn’t so much the poker I object to, as
his beastly taste in companions.”</p>

<p>“Thunder and blazes, Kit, what’s it to you who
Reggie goes with?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much. But of a kindness warn your
room-mate against Arty; he is an awful bounder and
always was.”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Tony, “Reggie knows him better
than we do; and it is certainly not my business to
give him advice. Come on; let’s quit this jaw, and go
in to supper.”</p>

<p>Disposed as Tony had been openly to defend Carroll
against this criticism, he condemned him yet the more
severely in his heart. He knew that Reggie realized the
defects of Chapin’s character; that he was spoiling his
chances of a prefectship the next year by his association
with him, and that he was running the risk of public expulsion
if it should be discovered that he was playing
poker. After a good deal of hesitation he made up
his mind to speak to Reggie on the subject. Accordingly
he waited that night until after lights, and then
slipped over to Reggie’s room, hoping to please him
by this suggestion of renewing their nightly talks. But
to his disappointment Carroll was not there. Tony
turned back into the study, and stood for a moment
at the window looking out upon the white campus,
flooded now with the light of a full moon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly he heard the latch of his door turn and
some one slip into the room.</p>

<p>“Hello, Reggie,” he whispered, “is that you?”</p>

<p>“Shish! no&mdash;it’s me&mdash;Kit,” came the soft reply.
“Jimmie is outside&mdash;we’re going to the Woods. Get
into your clothes and come along.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hang the Woods!” exclaimed Tony. “I am
sleepy and want to go to bed.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a quitter. Jim’s got a box from home;
we’ll have a bully good time, and we can get back
by midnight. Where’s your precious room-mate&mdash;gone
to the shanty?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know&mdash;I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps we’ll meet him; come on.”</p>

<p>The lark proved too strong a temptation, and after
a little more persuasion, Tony yielded. He slipped
on his trousers and a sweater, his stockings and boots,
and a coat, and was ready. The two boys crept
silently down the corridor, past the door of Mr. Morris’s
room, over the transom of which a bright light was
shining, and down the stairs. Once Kit tripped,
and they sank down below the head of the stairs,
just as Mr. Morris opened his door and stood at it
for a moment listening. Then the master closed his
door again, and the boys went out into the cold frosty
moonlight night, and joined Jimmie, who was waiting
for them at the fives-court.</p>

<p>Morris, however, was an old hand at his business, and
not a clumsy one. He stepped into his bedroom, which
was darkened, and going to the window stood there
watching. Presently he saw the three dark figures,
unrecognizable at the distance, creep along the fives-court,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
dash across to the cloister that led from Standerland
to the Schoolhouse, and then disappear behind
the clump of trees at the corner. Confident that he
had heard some one leaving his own dormitory, the
master then made his rounds, and surely enough
found that Deering, Lawrence and Wilson were missing.
Curiously enough Tony’s happened to be the last
room that he entered, and when he found his bedroom
empty, thus being sure that the three he had seen were
accounted for, he neglected to look into Carroll’s
room, and returned to his study to wait for their
return.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock as he sat before his fire, meditating
the course of his action, a rap sounded on the door,
and in response to his invitation, Doctor Forester
came in.</p>

<p>“Ah, Morris,” said the Head Master, coming forward
and standing with his back to the fire, “I am
sorry to disturb you at this time of night; but there
is mischief afoot, and perhaps you can help me catch
the offenders.”</p>

<p>Morris looked at the Doctor attentively, but for
the moment did not volunteer his information.</p>

<p>“This afternoon,” continued the Head, “Maclaren
found an old shanty back of the Third Ridge, rigged
out with the paraphernalia of a poker game. It has
evidently been in use, and from the character of the
débris, he thinks, by some of our boys. Maclaren
supposes that some of your boys have been getting
out at nights, and may be the culprits. Is that
possible?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Morris, “quite possible. I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
not have said so an hour ago, for I keep a close watch
upon that sort of thing, or at least I try to; but as a
matter of fact three of my boys are missing at this
moment.”</p>

<p>“Who are they?” asked the Doctor sharply.</p>

<p>“Lawrence, Deering and Wilson.”</p>

<p>“What! they are the last boys in the School that
I should be inclined to suspect of that sort of thing,
though I regret to say, Maclaren has some evidence
that I fear implicates Deering. Have you any idea
that they are gone to the Woods?”</p>

<p>“I fear they have, sir. I heard a noise in the hallway
a half-hour ago, and slipped out to see what it was.
For the moment I supposed I had been mistaken,
but a little later from my bedroom window I saw three
boys disappear back of the Schoolhouse. I did not
know who they were until I had made my rounds,
which was just a few minutes ago.”</p>

<p>“Well, they must be found. If they are implicated
in this affair at the Third Ridge shanty I shall deal
with them severely. Fine boys, too! it’s a great
shame.... Maclaren and Cummings are waiting
in my study; I will go and give them this clue.”</p>

<p>“If you like, sir, I will go for you, and go with them.”</p>

<p>“I would be obliged if you would. In that case,
I will remain here until your return.”</p>

<p>Morris put on his great coat and boots and started
out, while the Doctor settled himself before the fire
with a book. A little later the master with the two
prefects whom he had found at the Rectory, set out for
Lovel’s Woods.</p>

<p>Early in the evening Thorndyke, who was a member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of the crowd that frequented the shanty, had got wind
of Maclaren’s discovery through Lawrence Cumming’s
indiscreet confidences, and had hastened to the rendezvous&mdash;the
stone bridge by the Red Farm below
Deal Hill&mdash;and had warned his companions. They
had quietly returned to their dormitories; indeed,
while the Head Master and Morris had been talking
in the latter’s study, Carroll had softly stolen upstairs,
slipped into his room, and quietly got into bed.</p>

<p>Our other friends, following Kit’s ardent but injudicious
leadership, were making a detour to the
north on their way to their cave with an intention of
taking a peep at the nefarious doings at the shanty.</p>

<p>It was a long walk, and a cold one. Tony and
Jimmie had little heart for it, but the irrepressible
Kit led them gaily on. They skirted Beaver Pond,
threaded their way along the ridges over familiar
paths, and at last debouched upon the little clearing
in which the abandoned shanty was situated. On
every side stretched the thick woods, traversable
only by those who knew their devious paths. To the
east of the shanty the ridge ended abruptly, there was
a sheer descent, and over the tops of the trees on the
hillside one could get a splendid view of the distant
ocean, the Neck, and Deigr Island beyond the point,
with its light faithfully blinking red and white.</p>

<p>“No one about,” exclaimed Kit, peering in at a
dark window; “what a lark!”</p>

<p>“Now that we’re here,” said Jimmie. “I’m for
investigating.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! the window’s unfastened!” cried Kit,
already tugging at the sash. In a moment he had it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
up, and disappeared over the window-sill. He struck
a match inside and his companions could see him
moving about. Presently he found a candle, lighted
it, and set it on the table. “Come on in,” he called.
“Here’s a rummy old pack of cards.” And he kicked
the deck of cards across the room.</p>

<p>Deering and Lawrence climbed in and joined him
in an interested examination of the room. The structure,
which contained only this one room, it may be
said, had been built some years before by a gentleman
of the neighborhood, who had literary tastes, and
sought the quiet and seclusion of this spot for their
development. Of late it had been disused, however,
for a period of six or seven years. There was an old
table, a few rickety chairs, and a strong-box, such as
the boys used in their caves; aside from these no
furniture of any description. The embers of a wood
fire glowed on a great hearth at one side of the room.
In a cupboard the boys found several soiled packs
of cards, a pile of poker chips, and some empty cigarette
boxes. “The real dope, I suppose,” Kit commented
“is in the strong box, or hid some place outside.
I reckon we can’t bust into it. What a silly lot of
asses; if the prefects don’t get on to this, I’m a loser.
But what a jolly old joint it is, eh?”</p>

<p>“Rather,” said Jimmie. “There’s a pile of dishes in
the sink yonder&mdash;they’ve evidently had a feed here
this afternoon. There’s live coals on the hearth.
Hmmm&mdash;smell the tobacco!”</p>

<p>“Makes my mouth water,” was Kit’s prompt reply.
“Let’s fire up, and have our feed here, and leave a
note thankin’ ‘em for their hospitality. It isn’t likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
that anybody will turn up this time o’ night. Get
the bundle, Tony; and you, Jim, lend a hand while
we start the fire.”</p>

<p>The two began industriously to lay a fresh fire on
the great andirons, while Tony made for the window.
As he reached it there rose before him what seemed
a monstrous head and body. He gave a cry of alarm.
“Great heavens! who is it?” he screamed.</p>

<p>“Don’t have a fit, Deering; it’s only Maclaren.”</p>

<p>Tony immediately recovered his equilibrium. “Only
Maclaren!” he repeated, in a voice of despair. “It’s
all up, kiddos.” And he turned a white face to his
amazed companions in the shanty.</p>

<p>“Only Maclaren!” wailed Kit, as he threw his
bundle of faggots on the hearth. “You poor fool,
there’s Mr. Morris too.”</p>

<p>It was a sorry procession that wound its way
back to Standerland that cold January night. The
Doctor was waiting for them in Mr. Morris’s study,
grown a little impatient at the long delay. The
clock had struck eleven before he heard the footsteps
on the stairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Morris had rather deprecated explanations on
the way back, preferring to let the Head deal with the
case himself; nor were the boys much inclined to talk.
Upon their arrival at Standerland, Mr. Morris gave a
succinct account of their capture, while the Doctor
listened, a cloud gathering upon his brow.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said sternly, as Morris finished, “what
were you doing in Lovel’s Woods at this time of night?
Lawrence, you may answer for the three.”</p>

<p>“We skipped out just for the lark, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“You have been in the habit of paying these visits
to the Woods?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir&mdash;once in a while, sir,” Jimmie answered,
in rather a doleful tone.</p>

<p>“What have you done there?”</p>

<p>“Simply fooled about in our cave, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you call that shanty your cave?”</p>

<p>“No, sir&mdash;our cave is on the east side on the Third
Ridge.”</p>

<p>“Well, what were you doing at the shanty?”</p>

<p>“We were investigating it, sir; we had never been
there before.”</p>

<p>“None of you?”</p>

<p>“None, sir.”</p>

<p>“Is that true of you, Wilson?”</p>

<p>“I?” exclaimed Kit. “No, sir; that is, sir, I have
been there once before, but only on the outside and
looked in at the windows.”</p>

<p>“And you, Deering?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I have never been there before.”</p>

<p>Dr. Forester had turned on Tony like a flash.
“How then do you account for the fact that a letter
addressed to you was found there this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“A letter addressed to me found there!” exclaimed
Tony, in surprise. “I can’t account for it. I do not
know how it got there.”</p>

<p>“Do you know of other boys being there?”</p>

<p>“I believe other boys have been there; yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what boys have been there?”</p>

<p>“I really can’t say, sir.”</p>

<p>Tony was growing restless and ill at ease under this
severe cross-examination. It suddenly dawned upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
him, that the Doctor did not appear to accept his
replies as he gave them.... In his quick passionate
southern way he fired with resentment. His face
flushed, he stammered in giving his replies, and once
or twice inadvertently contradicted himself. Jimmie
and Kit looked at him in amazement; for a moment
the suspicion crossed their minds that Tony had perhaps
after all been going to the shanty with Carroll.
Even Morris, who had been serenely confident that
the boys would clear themselves of the charge of
gambling, showed a troubled countenance as the cross-examination
went on.</p>

<p>“Come, come,” said the Doctor, “I would like
you to suggest some explanation as to how a letter
addressed to you was found in that shanty this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I don’t account for it,” Tony replied. “I know
nothing about it. I know nothing about the shanty;
I never saw it until to-night.”</p>

<p>“That statement,” commented the Doctor mercilessly,
“conflicts with what you implied a few
moments ago. You allowed me to infer that you do
know what boys go there.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I do,” exclaimed Tony passionately.
“Suppose I do&mdash;I shan’t tell anything about it. I
have never been there, and I have nothing to do with
it.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, there is still another bit of evidence
that inevitably suggests to me the suspicion that you
must know more than you admit. The strong-box
in that shanty was rifled this afternoon by the Head
Prefect under my direction. In it were found several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
packs of playing cards, a quantity of poker chips,
and a memorandum-book.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir?”</p>

<p>“Do you know anything about that memorandum-book?”</p>

<p>“I do not.”</p>

<p>The Doctor drew it from his pocket as he spoke,
and opened it. “I find here various entries, evidently
sums of money owing to certain persons. I find here
the entry ‘A. D. to R. C.&mdash;$5.’ Between these pages
is a check on the First National Bank of New Orleans
drawn by you in your own favor and endorsed on the
back. Do you recollect such a check?”</p>

<p>Tony racked his memory, and recalled at last that a
week or so before he had given Reggie such a check
in payment of a small loan. “I made out such a
check; yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“To whom did you pay it?”</p>

<p>“I decline to tell you, sir.”</p>

<p>“What did you pay it for?”</p>

<p>“In payment of the sum of five dollars which I had
borrowed.”</p>

<p>“The boy to whom you paid this will corroborate
your statement?”</p>

<p>“Possibly, sir&mdash;I don’t know. I certainly shan’t
ask him to. I am accustomed to tell the truth.”</p>

<p>“You decline then to explain to me how this check
came to be found in this memorandum-book in the
strong-box of that shanty?”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about it to explain. I paid the
check to a friend. I don’t know how it came to be in
the shanty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you ever played poker in this school?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I have not.”</p>

<p>“Could this check have had anything to do with a
poker game?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know&mdash;not so far as I am concerned.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ‘so far as I am concerned’?”</p>

<p>“I mean that I have never played cards for money,
or given that check in payment for a gambling debt.
As to whether other boys have gambled in the shanty
or elsewhere, I do not know. I have nothing to
say.”</p>

<p>“You have broken bounds repeatedly this term?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“That will do for to-night. You three boys may go
to bed now. Report to me to-morrow morning at the
Rectory after Chapel. You will not attend recitations
or take any part in the school activities until this
matter is settled.”</p>

<p>The three culprits silently took up their caps and
went off to their rooms; Jimmie and Kit, distressed
and alarmed for themselves, but even more for Tony;
Deering was sullen and angry.</p>

<p>Doctor Forester sank back for a moment in his
chair and looked helplessly at his master and his
prefects. “I don’t think for a moment that that
boy is not telling the truth, Morris. But there is
the letter, the check, and the memorandum-book.
What do you make of it?”</p>

<p>“I would stake my life on his honor,” exclaimed
Morris generously. “For a moment I doubted him
when he was confronted with your evidence; but there
is an explanation for it, I am sure. Perhaps we will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
find it out; perhaps not. But whether we do or not,
I would take Deering’s word.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless you are right. His grandfather was the
same sort of hot-headed chivalrous youth, always
in trouble, always refusing to clear himself if there
were a shadow of doubt as to involving some one else.
Nevertheless, this business is to be probed to the
bottom, and I shall be inclined to expel the offenders
without mercy. Come, boys, get to bed now; come
to see me in the morning. You too, Morris. Good-night.
I don’t know when a case of discipline has
given me so much distress.”</p>

<p>When they were gone, Morris crossed over to
Deering’s room, and tapped on the door. Receiving
no reply, he opened it and walked in. As he found
no one in the study, he went into the bedroom, and
there he discovered Tony lying on the bed, shaken by a
storm of sobs. Carroll was sitting by his side, with
his arms around him, trying to get some explanation
of his distress.</p>

<p>Reggie looked up at the master. “What is the
trouble, Mr. Morris? I can’t get a word from Tony.”</p>

<p>Morris explained in a few sentences what had
happened.</p>

<p>“But, sir&mdash;he gave his word?”</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” exclaimed the master. “I believe
him absolutely, but I am afraid there is a strong
evidence against him that he will have to explain to
the Head.”</p>

<p>“But the Doctor must know that he is telling the
truth. I never knew him to misjudge a boy.”</p>

<p>“Even so&mdash;but whether he believes him or not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the Head is forced to probe the matter. He cannot
accept Tony’s refusal to speak, and you must admit,
Reggie, the letter, the check and the memorandum
are pretty strong evidence.”</p>

<p>Carroll paled, but he met the master’s gaze firmly.
“I can explain that, sir. The memorandum was made
out to a boy who has the same initials as Tony. I
left the check which Tony had paid me in the
memorandum-book by mistake.”</p>

<p>“You&mdash;Reginald!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes&mdash;I have been playing poker there all
this term, or at least for a good part of it. Is it too
late to go and tell the Doctor?”</p>

<p>“No, I think not; I believe he would like to know
to-night.”</p>

<p>Without a word Carroll rose up and left them.</p>

<p>Morris sat down then on the edge of the bed by
Deering’s side, and tried to calm him, making him
understand at last what Reggie had done. Then he
persuaded him to undress; and waited until he had
got into bed; then, with a quiet good-night, he turned
out the lights and left him alone.</p>

<p>The Doctor’s study contained a door which gave
directly upon the campus, so that the boys had easy
access to him without the formality of going to the
front door of the Rectory and sending their names
in by a servant. When the Doctor was busy and did
not wish to be disturbed, he placed a little sign in
the window to that effect. There was no such sign
as Reggie stood in the snow outside, at the foot of
the few steps that led to the study door. The window-shades
were up and Carroll could see the Doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
standing before the fire&mdash;a characteristic attitude&mdash;his
brows knit in perplexity. The boy’s heart went to
his throat, for like every Deal boy the Doctor’s good
opinion was what secretly he coveted intensely. But
there was only a moment’s hesitation before he went
up boldly and tapped at the door.</p>

<p>The Head Master was surprised to see him at that
hour of the night, and waited a little gravely for his
explanation.</p>

<p>Carroll made his confession in a few words, stating
the case against himself baldly and without a word of
palliation. “I have to say, sir,” he concluded, “that
I have only come to you to save Deering, who has had
absolutely nothing to do with the affair, and who told
you the entire truth. I could not sleep, sir, if I thought
you doubted his honor. Why, sir&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, Reginald, I agree with all that you can say
about Deering. I have persistently believed in the
boy despite the seemingly strong evidence against him.
I am glad you have set me right there. As for yourself,
you know that you have behaved badly, and I feel
your conduct deeply. But I think you are atoning for
it now in the sacrifice you are making for your friend.
I do not want to know the names of your companions
in this gambling episode, but I want to feel that I
may count on you from this moment to make an effort
to have it stopped.... Make no promises, but give
me reason to keep my trust in you from now on.”</p>

<p>He extended his hand. “Good-night now; tell Deering
to come to me after Chapel to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, sir,” said Carroll with a thick voice,
as he grasped the Doctor’s hand.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="pch">AN ENDING</p>

<p>“Well, Sandy,” said the Doctor to his head prefect
the next morning, as he waved the embarrassed Maclaren
to a comfortable chair, himself standing with
his back to the fire, “I am afraid I have been near
making a very bad mistake.” And he related in a
few words, without involving Carroll, the revelation
that had been made to him the night before.</p>

<p>“I see, sir,” said Sandy. “I suppose of course,
sir, that you can’t give me the name of your informant.
I should like to do a little investigating on my own
responsibility.”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t,” responded the Head decisively.
“And for some reasons I am sorry; but it was such
a manly and unselfish course for the boy to take,
that I freely forgave him and promised him immunity.
So far as he is concerned, I have no doubt that is the
best course. But there are others&mdash;the ringleaders,
I suspect. I want the investigation made, of course,
if you can do it without acting on mere suspicion.
If you can get me evidence in a straightforward way,
I shall act on it. Just now, I wish you would find
Deering and ask him to come in here to see me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Maclaren took his leave then, and the Head Master
turned to his morning mail.</p>

<p>Within fifteen minutes Tony stood before him.
He had not slept well and the strain through which
he had been passing had told on his appearance&mdash;his
freshness was dulled, there were circles under his
eyes, his usually eager manner was unwontedly quiet
and subdued.</p>

<p>The Head put the matter very briefly and frankly.
“The evidence seemed very strong against you, my
boy,” he concluded; “though I will say in justice to
you that even when things looked darkest I never
ceased to believe in you. I felt the difficulty, but I
saw no way out but to push things on.”</p>

<p>“I understand, sir,” Tony replied. The weight
was off his heart now, but he was still a little constrained
and self-conscious. He was thinking how
much he would like to say many things to Reggie
and wondering if he could say them when the opportunity
came.</p>

<p>“I must say, taking it all in all,” resumed the
Doctor, “that heredity seems to demonstrate itself
afresh in your case with unusual force. You remind
me uncommonly of your grandfather. There was an
affair at Kingsbridge in his sophomore year&mdash;a piece
of brutal hazing. It was rather bad, you know, in
our day. But Basil had had absolutely nothing to do
with it. He was captured by the proctors under
suspicious though in reality perfectly innocent circumstances,
and to save a guilty friend, he maintained
a stubborn silence to the verge of expulsion. The
friend’s confession at last saved him also.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Tony smiled. “That’s like my grandfather, certainly.”</p>

<p>“I admire the trait, you know,” continued Doctor
Forester, “but I think there are limits to its indulgence.
There is a point, as a boy seldom can realize, at which
the authorities must probe very much as the law
probes, with a fine disregard for personal feelings.
Things that deeply concern the moral welfare of the
boys here I must sometimes be inquisitorial about
in a way that I little like. I think it well to suffer for
a friend, but not to the extent of permitting untruth
to establish itself in the minds of those who after all
are responsible for your welfare.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid, sir, I don’t know where to draw the
line.”</p>

<p>“No, my boy, I am afraid you do not.”</p>

<p>“I think it was pretty fine of Carroll to come to you,
sir,” ventured Tony upon this.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, so do I. But I think also that it would
have been uncommonly mean if he had not. I have
forgiven Reginald, partly because of his confession,
partly too because I feel quite confident that he is
not the ringleader, that he too has been to some
extent a victim. I am not quite sure that he altogether
deserves the immunity I have promised him&mdash;the
complete immunity was a concession to you.”</p>

<p>“To me, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how, sir?”</p>

<p>“No? Well, perhaps some time you will. You
may go now. I am sorry for what has occurred;
sorry to have felt it my duty to accuse you, to probe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
your replies. You will consider yourself, however,
gated until further notice, and so will your friends,
Wilson and Lawrence. I do not propose to overlook
your breaking bounds at midnight. If that happens
again, look out for more serious trouble.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>They shook hands then, and Tony left.</p>

<p>How, how, mused the Head, as he looked after
the boy, was one to put pressure upon the keenness
of that sense of honor; and should one, if one could?
Sometimes even a head master realizes that there
are limits to his wisdom. One of the indications
that the limits of Doctor Forester’s wisdom were
less restricted than is often the case was the sincerity
with which he frequently questioned his own
actions.</p>

<p>After dinner Tony found his cronies waiting in the
quadrangle back of the Old School for a report on his
interview with the Head. He informed them briefly of
the fact that he had been cleared and discharged on the
several items of the accusations, but also of the penalty
of gating that had been imposed upon the trio.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all very nice and jolly,” said Kit,
as the three sat and kicked their heels against a bench
outside their form common-room, “and really not
much of a soak for the provocation we undoubtedly
gave ‘em. I only hoped in the old gentleman’s excitement
about the shanty that he’d forget our minor
sins. Not he! But, on the other hand, considering
that they spoiled the best part of the lark and insulted
you uncommonly by supposing all manner of rotten
immoral things, I’m equally torn as to whether it’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
not an awful roast and with wondering how we get
off at all, at all.”</p>

<p>“Say, kiddo, you are all tangled up,” said Tony,
feeling Kit’s head for indications of unsuspected
abnormalities.</p>

<p>“I am, I confess it,” that youth blandly responded.
“Kindly inform Jim and me, who’ve been unfeelingly
omitted from these interesting interviews, who
was the victim that went so willingly to the sacrifice?”</p>

<p>“Well,” interrupted Jimmie, “not Arty Chapin&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, Chapin’s a bounder.”</p>

<p>“Not Hen Marsh.”</p>

<p>“No, Hen’s a shadow of Arty’s, and a poor measly
sort of shadow at that.”</p>

<p>“Nor Buster Thorndyke.”</p>

<p>“Rather not,” assented Kit; “Buster’s just plain
garden variety of no good.”</p>

<p>“Well, there are other candidates, of course, for
the honor; but though nameless I guess we can count
on them failing to qualify&mdash;all of which rather narrows
the possibilities to Reginald Carter Westover
Carroll.”</p>

<p>“Now look here!” exclaimed Tony. “It’s to
Reggie’s credit or I wouldn’t admit it. Reggie’s
a peach. I can’t stand for a word against him. He’s
made everything all right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Reggie’s all right,” admitted Kit soothingly.
“Reggie is certainly all right. Haven’t I always said
so? Haven’t I deplored from the very beginning that
he was in with such a crowd of bounders. This only
proves that he’s too good for them. I only hope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>”
he added, with mock gravity, “that this will have
taught him a lesson and that in the future he will
model himself upon us.”</p>

<p>Upon this Tony turned and with a powerful swing
of his left arm swept Kit out off the bench onto the
snow. But Wilson, in his sudden descent, reached out
instinctively, grabbed Tony by an arm and a leg,
and pulled him down on top of him. Jimmie joyously
fell on the heap. For several blissful moments there
was wonderful rough-house. Tony emerged at last,
sent Jimmie sprawling, and established himself for a
brief triumphant moment on Kit’s stomach.</p>

<p>“Swear you’ll never tell any of it, or I’ll stuff your
mouth full of dirty snow. Swear!”</p>

<p>“I swear,” yelled Kit. “Let me up, you white
trash! Jim, to the rescue!”</p>

<p>But Tony was up and at bay, and by whirlwind
sparring was keeping Jimmie at his distance. Kit
was ludicrously slow, and had a bad thump on his
knee, which he rubbed ruefully as he arose with
exaggerated dignity.</p>

<p>“Cut it,” he bellowed. “Come on, do let’s crawl
back in the sun and be nice and quiet and comfy
again.”</p>

<p>The other two quickly desisted and helped the
wounded warrior to his seat. “I’m sorry, kid,” began
Tony. “Didn’t mean to hurt you. Does it hurt <i>so</i>
much, old man?” he added, teasingly.</p>

<p>Kit could not resist, but lumbered forward, despite
the thumped knee, and fell afresh on the light-footed
Deering.</p>

<p>“Keep off, Jim!” yelled Tony, and again they went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
crashing to the ground. “He has got to eat that nice
clean white snow.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;! I swear,” protested Kit. But they were
in for it, and with Jimmie standing by, after a few
moments of furious wrestling, both fed the other
handfuls of snow, until exhausted with laughter and
the effort, they lay supine and called on Lawrence
piteously to help them up.</p>

<p>“I’m off,” said Jimmie, “call-over bell is ringing,
and the Gumshoe’s on deck.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hang, oh hang the Gumshoe,” pleaded
Kit.</p>

<p>They picked themselves up, cheeks glowing, eyes
glistening, clothes and hair tossed.</p>

<p>“Such is life,” said Wilson, ostentatiously rubbing
his knee.</p>

<p>At this moment Mr. Roylston emerged from the
door of the Old School and was passing them on his
way to the Gymnasium to hold call-over. He glanced
at their disheveled clothes and paused.</p>

<p>“Will you take our names, sir?” asked Lawrence.</p>

<p>“Hm&mdash;yes,” replied the master at length. “And
may I ask, do you propose to wallow for the rest of
the afternoon in the dirt and snow?”</p>

<p>“Not much else to do, sir,” answered Kit ruefully,
“we’re gated.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” murmured Mr. Roylston, not making the
pretense of concealing his satisfaction, “to whom is
the credit of having awarded you with your just
deserts? I may ask?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir,” responded Kit blithely, “the
Head.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, indeed. Well, I will note your names.”
And with that he passed quickly on.</p>

<p>“Ain’t he the tender-hearted elder brother?” said
Kit, with a not altogether pleasant glance in the
direction of the master’s retreating figure. “Well,
I vote we play fox and geese and keep the amiable
Gumshoe chasin’ us through the houses. ‘Twill be
our only means of getting exercise.”</p>

<p>And fox and geese it was, and Mr. Roylston and
they had plenty of exercise, and that night Deering
and Lawrence and Wilson had a good long rest as
they stood outside of Mr. Roylston’s study-door in
Howard House until the clock struck twelve.</p>

<p>The gating, however, did not last many weeks, and
before long our friends were back at their old haunts
again.</p>

<p>Sandy Maclaren meanwhile was pursuing his investigation
with both ardor and discretion. He felt
certain of his victims, if he only had patience to watch
their doings carefully. Chapin and Marsh were in
his house, so that he could note their absences up
to lights without deliberately spying. After lights
Sandy was at a loss, for he did not believe in going
into a boy’s bedroom to see if he were there. Nor
on the other hand was it possible often to visit
the shanty. However he gained an unexpected ally
in his house master, Mr. Roylston. The doings at
the shanty in Lovel’s Woods had come to that gentleman’s
ears; he also had his suspicions; and he did not
share Sandy’s scruples about quietly making sure half-an-hour
after lights that none of his boys were out of
their rooms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>He came one evening toward the end of the term
to Maclaren’s study about half-past ten. Sandy was
almost ready for bed. “Chapin and Marsh are not
in their rooms, Maclaren,” he said.</p>

<p>“What, sir?” exclaimed Sandy, starting to his feet,
“how do you know, sir?”</p>

<p>“That is of no consequence. Chapin and Marsh
are out of their rooms.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where they are, sir?”</p>

<p>“I have some reason to suspect that they are playing
poker in that wretched shanty in the Woods.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but we raided that, you know; took all their
stuff,&mdash;if it was they.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but a clever criminal goes directly back
to commit his crimes in the same place. After a little
time he is nowhere so safe. Most fools think lightning
never strikes in the same place twice. I have suspected
them for some time, but I have not before
been sure that they were missing. I am sorry to ask
you to make a journey over to the Woods at this
time of night, but I cannot well leave the House.
You will probably find them, I think; in which case
you will direct them to report to me at once. I will
wait up until your return.”</p>

<p>Poor Sandy began to pull on his clothes. He did
not like the job, not merely because it was cold and
dark, but because he would have preferred to have
received the information from another master. He
was not adverse to catching Chapin and Marsh, if he
was to catch them, but he felt a little sorry for himself
as well as them that it all had to come on such a
night. He routed out Larry Cummings to go with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
them, and they started on the dismal journey. After
all, duty was duty, they reflected; and if that gang
could be broken up it would be a good thing for the
school.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when Sandy, Larry and their
victims&mdash;Chapin, Thorndyke and Marsh&mdash;returned
to Mr. Roylston’s study. The master received them
with a quiet satisfaction. It was a good, and thought
Sandy a little unkindly, an easy night’s work for him.</p>

<p>“You will all retire at once,” he said in grave
judicial tones, “and in the morning you will accompany
me to the Rectory.”</p>

<p>It was a clear case for the Head Master on the
morrow, though he singularly failed to congratulate
Mr. Roylston on the success of his detective work.
He suspended judgment until he could talk with
Mr. Morris about Reggie Carroll’s connection with
the affair.</p>

<p>Morris, when the Head had sent for him, was convinced
that Carroll deserved the leniency; that there
were chances for him in the school of making good that
did not exist for Chapin, that were doubtful for Thorndyke
and Marsh. Carroll certainly had improved,
markedly improved, since his confession. He had
broken, Morris felt, with his old crowd.</p>

<p>“Besides,” he added, “as for Chapin there is an old
score against him that should perhaps weigh with
you in your decision, Doctor Forester.”</p>

<p>“Yes?&mdash;what is that?”</p>

<p>Morris told the story of the Boxford game of the
year before.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see,” said Doctor Forester, and he did see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
with an admirable lucidity. “And Deering held his
tongue about that too?”</p>

<p>“About that too,” answered Morris.</p>

<p>“Unusual boy!”</p>

<p>“A very fine boy, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes, a fine boy. Well, I think that settles it.
After Chapin is gone I shall tell the prefects the whole
story, and I think perhaps it will be well that the school
should know it too, at least through them. We can
trust them to do justice to the football episode,
anyway.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you, sir,&mdash;now; but for a long time
I wanted to let things take their course. It has been
good for Deering. It has deepened his easy-going
pleasant nature; or rather it has served to bring out
the deep things that are in his nature.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes&mdash;that was right, I dare say. But that
you have told me now makes my course perfectly
clear. I am glad you have done so.”</p>

<p>Chapin was shortly summoned to the Rectory.
He had a brief and uncomfortable interview with
Doctor Forester, and an hour later he boarded a train
bound for Coventry, and was heard of at Deal School
no more. Marsh and Thorndyke and one or two
others were suspended for the rest of the term, and
after this house-cleaning the school settled down to
its normal life.</p>

<p>One afternoon not long after these events Doctor
Forester paused on the terrace of the Old School and
looked over the playing-fields. The snows had melted,
the frost was out of the ground, it was one of the
first warm days of the Spring shortly before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Easter vacation, and the boys were playing ball for
the first time, rushing the season as they commonly do.
Doctor Forester liked baseball, for it gave him less
anxiety than some other games.</p>

<p>Morris had joined him as he stood on the terrace
in the pleasant sunlight. Morris was an Old Boy, and
the Head had a special feeling for him that for the
most part he carefully concealed. He welcomed him
now with a sympathetic nod.</p>

<p>Just below them a rod or so away Jimmie Lawrence
and Tony Deering were passing ball.</p>

<p>“Good to see the baseball starting, eh? Who are
those two boys just below us? Deering and Lawrence?
I am getting blind, I fancy. I wish Deering were
as good a baseball player as he is a good football
player. Oh, yes, I know you like the other game.
Look, how quick he is! I like that. By the by, I have
thought often of what you told me of his keeping his
mouth shut about Chapin’s trick in the Boxford
game. It was like a Deering. His grandfather was
just such a chivalrous fool&mdash;such a good Christian,
Morris! I like a boy like that here. He will do something.
I wonder what?”</p>

<p>“Who knows, sir? We can count on him, I feel
sure of that.”</p>

<p>“And that is much. One muses of these boys now
and then&mdash;what the future has for them. Yes&mdash;you
do, I know. I envy you sometimes knowing them as
you can and do. How much one wants to do for them,
eh? That Deering, now&mdash;we must watch him. He
will be worth while.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so. We shall see, sir, just how.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, we shall see.” And still musing, the Doctor
turned away.</p>

<p>Morris stayed on for a long time watching the boys
on the playing-fields.</p>

<p>The Head Master had turned as he was about to
enter the Old School and glanced again at his younger
colleague, and a smile of quiet affection and satisfaction
stole over his keen kindly face.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pch">FINCH</p>

<p>One stormy night in the early autumn, two years
after the events narrated in the last chapter, a group
of masters were sitting in their common-room at
Deal School. Supper was just concluded; a cheerful
fire burned on the hearth, and the crackling of the
flames was a pleasing contrast to the roar of the wind
and the dashing of the rain without. Two of the
masters were playing chess under the light of a lamp,
the others were sitting before the fire, smoking and
talking.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Beverly, one of the younger men,
noted among his colleagues for his readiness to express
an opinion upon any subject in the universe,
“what do you think of the Head’s latest departure?”</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston pursed his thin close-shaven lips
as though he were about to reply, but before doing
so he carefully pressed the tobacco into his pipe, and
struck a match and applied it. “I don’t know,”
he muttered, between the puffs, in rather a high jerky
voice, “that it makes very much difference what we
think. But I am inclined to characterize it as an
arrival rather than a departure.”</p>

<p>“It is certainly very much with us,” commented
Gray, with an absent-minded glance into the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I predict its speedy extinction,” resumed
Beverly. “It is difficult for me to conceive how the
Doctor can suppose that Finch will ever get on
here. Upon my word, did you ever see such an
object?”</p>

<p>“Upon <i>my</i> word, I did not,” answered Gray. “But
here it certainly is, and in a sense it is bound to get
on. I am entrusted with its table manners, if one may
speak of what does not exist.”</p>

<p>“I believe that Morris is to have it in his house,”
said Roylston, looking over at the chess players.</p>

<p>“It? who? Oh, you are talking about Finch, eh?
Queer little duffer, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Queer?” murmured Beverly in a tone that spoke
volumes of intense pity for the limits of Morris’s
vocabulary. “Perhaps you can really tell us something
about it, Mr. Morris?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much, I’m afraid,” Morris replied. “The
Doctor has some special interest,&mdash;he’s a trust, I
understand, from a very old friend. It is very much
up to us, I fancy, to help make things easy for the
poor kid. I shall speak to some of the boys in my
house about him, and ask them to go out of their way
to be a bit decent.”</p>

<p>“Speedy execution were the more merciful, I should
say,” commented Mr. Roylston, taking a comfortable
pull at his pipe.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! he’ll make good,” said Morris, a shade
of irritation crossing his face, “that is, if we give him
half a chance.”</p>

<p>“I don’t precisely see why we should be supposed
to give him less or more chance than we give to every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
boy,” said Beverly, a little pompously. “I am sure
we all&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i>We</i> can’t perhaps,” Roylston rejoined, “but
doubtless Mr. Morris, who has the advantage of
certain confidential relations with the boys of his
house which we do not enjoy, probably can.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, Roylston,” exclaimed Morris, making
a bad move in his game with Stenton. “Of course,
I shall use my influence with the boys in my house
to make things easy for poor Finch. Why should
I not?”</p>

<p>“Echo answers ‘why,’” replied Mr. Roylston,
somewhat annoyed; and then he added with an air
of indulgence, “but be assured, my dear fellow, I
have no intention of criticising your extraordinary
theories afresh.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Morris and gave his attention
to his game. “Your move, Stenton, I think.”</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston sent a characteristic glance of patient
suffering in the direction of his colleague, and then held
up his hands for the benefit of the company as though
to say, “You see how useless it is to discuss these things
with our friend over there.” He then bade them all a
tart good-night, and went off to keep his duty in the
schoolroom.</p>

<p>His way led across the Gymnasium. There, in
the center of a crowd of boys engaged in making his
life miserable, stood the new boy, Finch, who had
just been the subject of conversation in the masters’
common-room. He was a sorry specimen of a boy,
to be sure; the sorriest probably that through mistaken
kindness had ever found his way to a great school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of wholesome, healthy youngsters. He was thin, he
was pallid, he was ugly. He had the face of a little
old man, weak light eyes, a high dome-like forehead,
over which straggled little wisps of thin yellow hair.
His ill-formed mouth was parted now in a snarl half
of rage, half of terror, as he glanced from one jibing
boy to another, like a hunted rat. His clothes were
too small for him, and his thin little legs, which long
since should have been concealed by long trousers,
were incased in bright red knitted stockings. These
had acted upon the imagination of his schoolmates
like the proverbial red rag upon a bull, and were the
subject of the stream of jibes and jokes that were
being heaped upon him. It was not a representative
crowd of boys that surrounded him, but a miscellaneous
crew of lower schoolers who had followed in the
wake of a fat Third Form boy, known as Ducky Thornton,
the self-appointed chief inquisitor of the moment.
The noise was unduly loud, consisting for the most
part of catcalls and strange and weird squeaks from
the throats of a dozen excited small boys. It was the
sort of commotion that under ordinary circumstances
Mr. Roylston would have promptly checked and
rewarded with a liberal distribution of pensums.
Such indeed had been his immediate impulse, but as
he started to carry out his purpose, he had caught
sight of Finch and there had flashed into his mind
the irritating exchange of words about him in the
common-room. He checked the feeling of compassion
for the new boy and his annoyance at the disturbance,
and passed quickly into the cloister that led into the
schoolroom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately for Finch a more resolute champion
now appeared upon the scene. It was Kit Wilson&mdash;on
his way across the Gymnasium. Quick as a flash
he took in the situation, and, crossing the room with a
leap and a stride, he landed in the midst of the party
of “horsers.” He grabbed one small boy by the
collar of his coat and sent him spinning out into the
middle of the Gymnasium, another he pushed out of
his way with something of his football manner, and
ended by applying a kick to Ducky Thornton that
even that well-cushioned individual was apt to remember.
“Here, you infernal cads!” he cried, “cut
this out! what the deuce do you think you’re up to?”
The crowd of small boys scattered instantly, leaving
poor Ducky, with rueful face and painful limp, to
hobble away by himself, pursued by a volley of Kit’s
variegated vocabulary that was more picturesque
than elegant.</p>

<p>Finch stood still where Kit had found him as if
transfixed. He was relieved, thankful for the rescue,
but incapable of saying so. His face looked hideous
in the bright glare of the electric light, drawn as it
was by anguish and blazing with what seemed like
superhuman hate. Kit stared at him a moment,
amazed by the passion of the boy’s face; almost
shocked by its weird uncanny venom. Conquering
the instinctive feeling of revulsion, he put his hand
on the boy’s shoulder. “You poor little duffer,” he
said, “I’m sorry for you. Don’t take it too hard.
They’re a crowd of little curs, but their bark is worse
than their bite.”</p>

<p>“I hate them,” snarled the boy. “I hate them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>”
Then his face relaxed, and the light faded in his little
blue eyes, as they suffused with tears. “Thank you
all the same,” he added, his voice still trembling with
passion.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” asked Kit.</p>

<p>“Jacob Finch.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you’re the new boy, eh? Where do you come
from?”</p>

<p>“Coventry. I wish I was back. I can’t stand it
here.”</p>

<p>“Rot!” exclaimed Kit, with the easy-going philosophy
of popularity and success. “Cut along to the
schoolroom now, and let me know if Ducky Thornton
bothers you again.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Finch murmured, and dropping his
head, he stole off through the cloister, keeping well
within the shadow of the wall until he reached the
schoolroom. There he was received by Mr. Roylston,
who showed him a seat, and immediately afterwards
called the room to order.</p>

<p>Kit, having watched Finch out of sight, stalked
off grandly across the Gymnasium, dropping a word
of warning here and there to the groups of small boys
who had watched the encounter from a safe distance.
Ducky Thornton witnessed his departure from an
angle in the wall, whither he had retired with a few of
his satellites. His face, at no time very attractive,
wore now a most repulsive expression of contempt.
“By golly,” was his comment, “he’s the swell head,
ain’t he? I wonder if he hurts?”</p>

<p>“Not as much as you do, Ducky, I guess,” squeaked
a premature wit and got his ears cuffed for his effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>A few minutes later Wilson dropped into the study
of Number Five Standerland, which Deering and Lawrence
were sharing that year, Carroll having been
promoted to the Old School, a privilege of the Sixth.
The two boys were sitting at their desks, books open,
it is true, but rather deeper in football than Virgil.
Kit received a characteristic welcome.</p>

<p>“Hello, old sport, drape yourself on a couch, and
listen to this fairy tale about the pious Æneas. Tony’s
boned it out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, chuck the stuff!” growled Kit. “I’ll do it
after breakfast with a trot. I’ve only got ten minutes
now for a pow-wow. Have you seen the new kid?”</p>

<p>“Well, rather,” answered Jimmie, “the Doctor
has loaded him onto Bill. He’s to have Number
Three single right across the hall. The little beast is
in the Fifth.”</p>

<p>“Pon honor?” said Kit. “Why, he looks like a
sub-First Former. I just rescued him from a crowd
of Lower Schoolers that were putting it to him particularly
nastily. I gave Ducky Thornton, that
wallowing white elephant of the Third, a kick that
I reckon’ll make his sitting down uncomfortable for
a week. But Finch is such a gloomy little toad that
I was almost sorry I’d done it.”</p>

<p>Tony smiled. “That must have been good fun.
But I am sorry the Doctor took him here; can’t understand
it, in fact. He’ll never do, poor rat!”</p>

<p>“Well, hardly.”</p>

<p>“By the by, kiddo, what&mdash;&mdash;Come in!” he interrupted
himself to cry in response to a knock at the
door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Morris entered and was welcomed by the boys in
a manner that bespoke both familiarity and deference.
The master waved them back into their comfortable
chairs. “Thanks, no; I am not going to rob the lot
of you of these precious moments of study. I should
like to speak to you, Tony, for a few minutes in my
study.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir.” Tony followed the master down
the hallway to the familiar cheerful study&mdash;Tony
had really got to know his house-master more intimately
the year before.</p>

<p>“Make yourself comfortable,” said Morris, “for
I want to talk with you for a little while&mdash;quite seriously.”</p>

<p>Tony sat down upon the couch, leaned back amongst
the pillows and put his hands beneath his head,
looking up at Morris who stood on the hearth rug
with his back to the open wood fire. “All right,
O wise man!” he laughed. “I am very comfy, and
all attention.”</p>

<p>Morris looked down at the boy and seemed to study
him afresh. He liked Deering very much indeed,
better he felt than he had ever liked a boy before. And
as he stood there, he told himself that the reason was,
that beside Tony’s personal charm, the brightness and
lovableness of his sunshiny open nature, there were
depths of feeling and purpose that one ordinarily did
not find. “Well, Tony, I want you to do something&mdash;something
quite out of the ordinary&mdash;something indeed
that I think will be particularly hard and disagreeable.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the boy, “I don’t exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
crave hardship, but there isn’t a lot I wouldn’t do if
you specially asked me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I count on that; that’s partly the reason I
am asking you rather than another. I want you to
make a special effort to look out for Finch.”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz! Mr. Morris,” exclaimed Tony, sitting
upright, and assuming an expression of exaggerated
horror. “I’ve seen him! I’ll be decent, of course.
But really, I don’t see how I can possibly stand taking
that little scarecrow under my wing. Why, Jimmie
and Kit would&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I know their attitude; but you know as
well as I that they would back you up in the matter.
I want you to be more than decent. The boy is here,
and the Head has strong reasons for wanting him to
make good. As you know, all the chances are against
his doing so. In truth, I should say, that the boy has
no chance unless an old boy, more or less of your
caliber, will definitely take him up and befriend him.”</p>

<p>“Nobody is going to hurt him,” protested Tony.
“Why, Kit just now rescued him from Ducky Thornton
and a crowd of little bullies.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” answered Morris, “but that is
only a drop in the bucket. That boy’s life will be
unbearable unless he makes a friend. And I do not
believe there is a boy in the school who would be his
friend, <i>really his friend</i>,&mdash;except you.”</p>

<p>“His friend, Mr. Morris?...!”</p>

<p>“Nothing else helps you know&mdash;<i>nothing</i>.”</p>

<p>Tony grew serious. He thought of what friendship
had meant to him:&mdash;Jimmie&mdash;his eyes moistened at
the thought of him; Carroll; Morris, the man before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
him, whose deep kind gray eyes were looking at him
now so confidently. “Mr. Morris,” he said at last,
“you do know me, I reckon; you bank on my being
clay in your hands.” Then he laughed, “What’s the
brat’s name?&mdash;Pinch?”</p>

<p>“No, Finch, Jacob Finch.”</p>

<p>“Well, all right&mdash;Finch.... The dickens fly away
with him. Good-night, maestro.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, my boy.” They clasped hands for a
moment, and Tony was gone.</p>

<p>“I am an ass,” he said, flinging himself on the couch
by the side of Kit, when he returned to Number Five.
“I’ve promised Bill to be a guardian angel to that new
kid.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE DISCOMFITURE OF DUCKY THORNTON</p>

<p>Fifth Form year in a school like Deal usually marks
a decided change in the boys; they have grown more
mature, have become more serious in various ways, have
definitely put away&mdash;the most of them&mdash;the childish
things of school life, and are to be counted as standing
for the most part on the side of the powers of law and
order. They are used to the ways of the place, are
thoroughly imbued with the school spirit and tradition,
and consciously aim at keeping themselves and their
fellows in the good old ways.</p>

<p>Tony’s first year at Deal in the Third Form, as we
have seen, had been a varied one. After the exciting
events of the Michaelmas and Lent terms, his life
had pursued a more even tenor of way. Chapin’s detection
and expulsion had served to reinstate Deering
in the confidence of both masters and boys, and his
genial sunshiny nature was winning for him a deserved
popularity. He and Carroll, the latter now a Sixth
Former, though they no longer roomed together, were
excellent friends, but his real intimates were Kit
Wilson and Jimmie Lawrence, the latter of whom
shared his room in Standerland, while Kit lived but
a few doors down the corridor. With Mr. Morris,
the house master, he was on very good terms indeed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
He had made his place in the football team in Fourth
Form year, and had played a good game but he
had not distinguished himself that year. Now again
in the Michaelmas term of the Fifth Form year he
was engaged in daily football practice, and was again
looking forward to the exciting contest in November.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to say that Tony’s two
friends had not taken his declaration of making a
friend of Finch very seriously, though they decided
with him in a good-natured way to protect the new
boy from the thoughtless or ill-natured hazing he
was like to get at the hands of lower formers.</p>

<p>A night or so after Finch’s arrival at school, Reggie
Carroll dropped in at Number Five Standerland to see
his younger friends. Jimmie was working in the
study, but Tony had turned in early. Reggie stuck
his head into the door of Deering’s bedroom and discovered
its occupant, having got ready for bed, just
about to turn off the light. “Come in,” said Tony,
“and find something comfortable to sit down on&mdash;the
bed will do. Where are you wandering this time of
night?”</p>

<p>“Well, it is only nine o’clock,” said Reggie, “and
as a matter of fact, I was wandering over to have a
‘jaw’ with you, as you sometimes so delicately term
a heart to heart talk.”</p>

<p>“Well, fire away,” said Tony, but in tones that
did not hint he expected to find the conversation
interesting. He was rather pensive, unwontedly
silent, and looked out of his window over the dark
fields.</p>

<p>Reggie essayed several topics of conversation, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
without much success. He was about to take his
leave, when something in Tony’s expression arrested
his attention.</p>

<p>“What on earth is the matter with you, boy?”
he asked at last, as he playfully grabbed Tony by
the shoulder and began to maul him.</p>

<p>“Let up!” cried Tony. “Can’t you see I’m thinking
out the problems of the universe? You mess me all
up and I don’t know where I’m at.”</p>

<p>“Well, compose yourself, and let me offer you
advice.”</p>

<p>“Let up then, do! And consider the appropriateness
of the figures of speech, as Gumshoe would say. Bill
Morris has been darn white to me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Rather,” commented Reggie, with a smile, “we
are all green with envy at his whiteness.”</p>

<p>“Don’t interrupt; as I was trying to say, Mr. Morris
has been exceedingly white to me; so much so that I
have often wondered how I might show him I appreciate
it. Well, the fact is, he has asked me to do something
just lately that I don’t in the least want
to do, and I don’t see how in the deuce I am to get
out of it.”</p>

<p>“Knowing Morris,” commented Carroll, lazily, “I
don’t in the least fancy you are going to get out of it.
He lays his plans too well. What does he want?”</p>

<p>“Have you seen Finch, the new boy?”</p>

<p>“Finch?&mdash;oh! the kid they call Pinch. Yes, boy, I
have seen him; one look was too much. It’s awful.”
Then Reggie’s eyes lighted, and he gave an exclamation.
“By Jove, I see it all&mdash;the whole thing&mdash;Bill
wants you to be his guardian angel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“Precisely,” said Tony, with an expression of
infinite disgust.</p>

<p>“And you, my child, fully mean to be.”</p>

<p>“Hang it!” said Tony. “I suppose I do.”</p>

<p>For a moment Carroll was silent and his expression
changed from one of good-natured raillery to one of
subtle sadness.</p>

<p>“Poor little devil!” he said at last, “why not?”
Tony looked at him to see if he were joking.
“Oh, I know I couldn’t do it,” Reggie went on.
“I haven’t the knack or the grace, or whatever it
is called. But old Bill is right; you have. Why,
kiddo, the world’s a hell for a lot of people just because
the rest of us, who have had more of a chance, sit
tight and comfy and don’t care.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is,” said Tony grimly, “but to tell
the truth, I hate to think about such things&mdash;for a
while yet, anyway.”</p>

<p>“There is one thing to be said,” Carroll continued,
without paying any attention to Tony’s remark,
“if you do it, do it from the bottom up. Make a
good job of it.”</p>

<p>“It’s sheer asininity,” protested Tony. “I can’t
do it. Oh, Reggie, I hate him! he’s a loathsome little
reptile.”</p>

<p>“Naturally he is that, or Bill would not be so extraordinary
on the subject. He doesn’t mess with our
affairs very often, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” Tony muttered.</p>

<p>“Do you chance to know why the Head took
him?”</p>

<p>“Not really&mdash;some family obligation, I believe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
The kid was left to him by unspeakable parents who
died of disgust at their work.”</p>

<p>Carroll smiled. “Have you begun yet?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No. I have sworn fifty times a day that I’d have
nothing to do with it. And now I am going to get
up this blessed minute and go in and have a talk
with him. Talk to Jim a bit, and I’ll be back and
tell you about it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Carroll with a smile. Tony jumped
out of bed, folded his blue wrapper about him tragically,
struck a dramatic attitude, and stalked out of the
room. Reggie joined Lawrence in the study.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Tony returned.</p>

<p>“How’s Pinch?” exclaimed Lawrence.</p>

<p>“How did it go?” asked Carroll.</p>

<p>Tony flopped down on a couch with an air of exhaustion.
“Oh, so, so. I found him greasing on his
confounded Virgil in a blue funk for fear I’d come
to haze him. I made him read me twenty-five lines
to give him a chance to recover himself, while I
looked to see if I could find a redeeming feature.
But Nature left that out. After a while I began
firing questions at him, and when he gradually grew
accustomed to the idea that I was only trying to be
decent, he thawed a bit, and told me a little about
himself. He’s had a tough time generally since he
had the misfortune to come into the world at all.
His father, who was an old college chum of the Doctor’s,
seems to have turned out a sort of a rotter. He did
something or other that disgraced them, and then he
died and left that kid and his mother to face the
music alone. She, poor woman, didn’t last long, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
then the Head stepped in, for old time’s sake, and out
of mistaken kindness of his stupid old heart brought
Finch here.... All the spirit has been kicked out
of him. He’ll do at his books&mdash;he read the Virgil
pretty well&mdash;but he hasn’t the spunk to resent being
kicked by a First Former. He seems to live in a
perpetual terror of his own shadow. I suspect Ducky
Thornton and his gang have been ragging him on the
quiet, and if I catch that fat loafer at it, I promise
you he’ll be sorry. I think I’ll give him a good kicking
to-morrow on general principles.”</p>

<p>“Do!” said Reggie, “that will be good for him
in any case.... It might be well for you both to
keep an eye on Ducky’s whereabouts in the afternoons.
I have a notion that he skulks in the fives
court till the master of the day is out of the way,
and then sneaks back into the house. I have seen him
half-a-dozen times inside, and if I had been a prefect
I should have kicked him out myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hang being a prefect where kicking Ducky is
concerned. To do that would be good for both our
souls.”</p>

<p>Carroll laughed. “Well, at it, boy.” He said
good-night then, and left them.</p>

<p>The next day&mdash;a bright fair day in mid-November,
only a few days before the Boxford game, when the first
team were laying off from practice, Tony and Kit, instead
of going out early for a walk with their team-mates,
went into the fives court after dinner and began
a game, keeping an eye, however, on the on-lookers.
It rejoiced them to see Thornton’s fat ill-natured
face amongst a crowd of loafers on the benches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
The bell rang for call-over, and the boys ran out
to report to the master of the day, who was accustomed
to take his stand at the Gymnasium door.
To-day Mr. Roylston happened to be on duty. The
roll call over, most of the boys went off to engage
upon some form of exercise or game for the afternoon;
but a few lazy ones, disdaining the occupations open
to them, straggled back into the fives court to watch
the games going on there. Later they would swim
in the tank, and then stand for half-an-hour under a
steaming hot shower, unless a vigilant master happened
to catch them and send them about better things.
Among these stragglers was Ducky Thornton.</p>

<p>About half-an-hour later Mr. Roylston, beginning
to make his rounds of the various houses&mdash;a customary
duty of the master in charge&mdash;came into the fives
courts. He stood at the door, noting on his rollslip
the boys who were present. By this time only
Tony and Kit were playing and some half-a-dozen
smaller boys were squabbling on the benches. Tony
glanced at the master, and saw beyond him, standing
outside on the deserted tennis-courts, the forlorn
Finch who looked about him in a bewildered fashion
as if he did not know what to do.</p>

<p>As Mr. Roylston finished making his notes, he
fixed Tony and Kit with a glare of unmitigated contempt.
“The delight of doing nothing for some
boys,” he said in a sharp, jerky tone, “is only equalled
by their incapacity to do anything. Get out into the
air, and take some manly exercise, or I shall send the
lot of you for a walk to the end of the point.”</p>

<p>The younger boys sheepishly slipped out, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
scowling Thornton amongst them, who, Tony noticed,
stopped outside and spoke to Finch for a moment.
Suddenly he realized that Mr. Roylston was still
speaking. “Oh, I beg your pardon, sir,” he said
quickly. “I did not understand that you were speaking
to us.”</p>

<p>“If you would condescend occasionally, Deering,”
said the master, “to abstract yourself from the depths
of self-satisfaction into which you are habitually
plunged, you would not make it necessary for me to
take your inattention for mere bad manners.”</p>

<p>Tony flushed, started to speak, bit his tongue, and
kept silent. He met Mr. Roylston’s glance unflinchingly.
“Did you wish to say anything, sir?” he said
at last, with tantalizing politeness.</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston’s eyes turned aside from the cool but
perfectly courteous gaze with which the boy regarded
him. “Merely,” he added, as he turned away, “that
I think you older boys&mdash;members of the first team at
that&mdash;set a very bad example by frowsing in the
fives court on a glorious autumn afternoon like this.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s the first game we’ve played this year,”
cried impulsive Kit. “It’s come to a pretty pass if
Fifth Formers can’t play a game of fives without being
accused of setting a bad example.”</p>

<p>“That will do, Wilson,” exclaimed Mr. Roylston
sharply, facing them again with an indignant glare
in his eye. “You have not yet got over your unpleasant
habit of impertinence when occasion offers.
Be good enough, please, to leave the courts immediately.”</p>

<p>Kit reached for his coat, and as he did so he flung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the fives ball with a vicious twist against the side of
the courts, so that it bounced back with a tremendous
spring, and narrowly escaped collision with the
master’s head as he was passing through the doorway.
But Mr. Roylston, having scored, as he thought, did
not give them the satisfaction of looking back. “Gosh!”
exclaimed Kit, “I wish it had hit him.”</p>

<p>“Wish it had!” said Tony. “Come on; time’s up
anyway. Gumshoe’ll go through the Old School
now, and we’ll have a look to see what has become of
Ducky.... I’ll wager Finch has sneaked back to his
own room. He mopes there all free times, and has
about fifty marks already for doing it. If Ducky’s
not there, we’ll send him out for a run. If Ducky
is&mdash;well, kiddo&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Kit, significantly stuffing a long
leathern strap into his trousers pocket.</p>

<p>They turned out of the courts. No one was in
sight; the small boys under the influence of Mr. Roylston’s
“suggestions” had vanished; even Finch, who
had been annihilated by a sarcastic phrase as the
master passed him, had crept somewhere to hide till
it was time for afternoon school. Tony and Kit
watched Mr. Roylston until he disappeared into the
Old School, then they started on a run for Standerland.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet the brute has got Finch in his room. It’s
just the time for it; besides Bill has gone over to the
Woods with a lot of kids. Softly, Kit,” he said, as
they pushed open the big doorway leading into the
main hallway of Standerland House. They tiptoed
cautiously upstairs, and when they got to the head,
stopped to listen, holding their breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sish! what’s that?” whispered Kit.</p>

<p>They heard a clear long wail in a high shrill voice&mdash;“Pleaseeeee!”
ending in a squeal, followed by a deeper
guffah, and the sound of a whip’s lash.</p>

<p>“Hurry!” said Tony. “We’ll make that bully
sweat for this.” Quick as a flash he was at Finch’s
door, trying the handle. It was locked; so he pounded
vigorously. “Open up!” he called, “and the sooner
the better. Open up, you fellows&mdash;do you hear?”
There was a scuffle within; then silence. Some one
crossed the room rapidly, and opened the door. It
was a Third Form boy by the name of Clausen&mdash;a
surly bad-complexioned lad. His face showed white
now through the ugly blotches. Tony and Kit stepped
quickly within, and closed and locked the door behind
them.</p>

<p>Finch was sitting on the edge of the bed, whimpering.
His coat and shirt were lying on the floor. Across
his back were the welts of several long lashes. Another
boy&mdash;Dunstan, a Fourth Former, in bad odor with
the prefects, one of Thornton’s satellites&mdash;was by the
window, as if he were on the point of jumping out.
Fortunately the room was on the second storey of the
building. No one else was in sight. Kit grabbed
Dunstan and flung him on the bed; but Tony, strangely
cool, his eyes glittering, restrained him.</p>

<p>“Wait, Wilson,” he said. “Take the key out of the
door. Now, you Dunstan, where is Thornton?”</p>

<p>The boy did not answer. “Where’s Thornton?”
repeated Tony, grasping Dunstan by the neck and
wringing it. “He’s here, I know; or he was here.
He couldn’t get out. Here, Kit, tie this animal while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
I look in the closets,” and he slung a bit of cord to his
companion. They made short work of the Fourth
Former, who indeed made scarcely any show of resistance;
and then, having slung him helpless on the
bed, they began to search for Thornton. As Kit
opened the closet in Finch’s bedroom, Ducky darted
out, and made for the hall door. But Tony was too
quick for him. He grasped him from behind, pinioned
his arms behind his back, and dug his knees
into Thornton’s hips. The fat boy went to the floor
like a log, and in a second Tony was kneeling over
him with sharp knees digging into the soft flesh about
his armpits. Kit gathered the boy’s sprawling feet
together and tied them with a big muffler that he
took from Finch’s bureau.</p>

<p>Finch himself, during the struggle, had stopped
crying, and was now putting on his shirt and coat.
He had just begun to realize that this was a rescue,
not a fresh attack upon himself.</p>

<p>“Now, Finch,” said Tony, opening the door into
the hall, “cut across to my room, and stay there until
we come. Kit, take that little beast Clausen, and
kick him down stairs. We won’t bother any further
with him.” Kit executed this order with dispatch
and thoroughness, and Clausen thanked his stars
that he had got off so easily. Having got rid of Finch
and Clausen, they relocked the door. “Now, you
big fat bully,” said Deering, “you are going to get it.
Get up and pull off your coat and shirt.”</p>

<p>As Thornton struggled to his feet&mdash;the operation
was a clumsy one, as his ankles were lashed close
together,&mdash;he began volubly: “You big bullies!” But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
he did not go far. “Here,” said Kit, “wash his
mouth out, Tony.” And Tony washed it out with
plenty of Castile soap and very little water. “Now
strip!” said Tony. The bully slowly took off his coat,
and then his shirt. “It’s not a pretty sight, is it,
Kit?” laughed Tony. “Nevertheless it will hurt as
much as Finch’s back. Bend over.”</p>

<p>“Please, please, let me off. ’Pon honor, I’ll never do it
again&mdash;I swear&mdash;I swear&mdash;please don’t lick me; please,
<i>please</i> don’t lick&mdash;ouch!” He suddenly collapsed
with a squeal of anguish, as Tony brought the leathern
strap across his shoulders with an unmerciful swish.
“You wouldn’t let Finch off when he blubbered, would
you? Well, we won’t let you off. Ready? Coming.”</p>

<p>“Ouch! ouch!!&mdash;oh, I swear&mdash;please&mdash;oh, you bullies,
you&mdash;ouch! owhhh!” Then Kit stuffed a towel in
his soap-suddy mouth and stilled the noise. When
he had been well punished, they flung him on the bed,
and let him howl there while they administered a
like thrashing to Dunstan. He bore it a little more
manfully, and consequently got off more easily.
Suddenly they were all startled by a sharp knock on
the door. “Gumshoe! by the great horn spoon!”
exclaimed Kit. “Yes,” he called, “who is it?”</p>

<p>“Open, open this door instantly,” came in the well-known
tones of Mr. Ebenezer Roylston. “Open instantly,
or I shall send for the servants to break it in.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir,” called Kit, adding <i>sotto voce</i>, “It
would be a jolly good stunt if we let him do it. Get
on your coats,” he hissed at the two Fourth Formers.
Instinct prompted them to quickness; but not quick
enough to satisfy Mr. Roylston, for the order was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
repeated, and the handle of the door rattled impatiently.</p>

<p>Kit unlocked the door at last, and Mr. Roylston
entered. “What is the meaning of this unseemly
commotion? What are you doing with locked doors
when you are supposed to be out? What is the meaning
of this strap? Why are these two Fourth Formers
here crying? There has been bullying?”</p>

<p>Kit laughed. “That’s about it,” he said. An
angry flush suffused Mr. Roylston’s countenance, as
he exaggerated Kit’s laugh into impertinence. “You
are going too far, Wilson. I shall report you to the
Head for bullying and gross impertinence. You also,
Deering&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You might as well take the trouble to find out
what you are going to report us for,” said Kit.</p>

<p>“Shut up, Kit,” said Tony. “If you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Silence, Deering,” interrupted Mr. Roylston.
“I am perfectly capable of rebuking a boy for insolence
without your assistance. You, Thornton and
Dunstan, come with me. You, Deering and Wilson,
go to your rooms, and wait there until you are sent
for.”</p>

<p>He waited until they had crossed the hall and
gone into Tony’s room; then he took Thornton and
Dunstan into Mr. Morris’s study at the end of the
hall and was closeted with them for half an hour.
Later the boys saw him leave Standerland House,
cross the quadrangle and disappear within the Old
School. Then they sent Finch back to his room,
reconnoitred, but found that Dunstan and Thornton
had disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>An hour later there came a tap on their door. Kit
opened it, and admitted Mr. Roylston. The master
took his place with his back toward the window, and
made them stand in the light before him. He cleared
his throat once or twice, as though he were at a loss
quite how to begin. “I have made an investigation,”
he said at last, “and have carefully thought over this
afternoon’s affair.” He waited as if for a reply, but
as the boys made none, he continued in a moment,
a little more sharply and confidently. “I find that
you are both guilty of the most wanton cruelty to
boys younger and smaller than yourselves; though,
I understand&mdash;they were singularly frank and direct
with me&mdash;that you are not without what you will
probably pretend is justification. Thornton admits
that he had been horsing Finch&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Horsing Finch!” began Kit.</p>

<p>“Silence, Wilson; if there is any occasion for either
of you to speak, pray, let Deering speak for you. I
have endured about as much of your impertinence
to-day as I can well stand. You undertook to punish
younger boys, and did so cruelly. In my opinion
your conduct is indefensible. However, I shall take
into consideration your mistaken motives in the
matter, and not report you to the Head, as I was
at first convinced it was my duty to do. Doctor
Forester is wont to deal severely with bullying. Instead,
I shall gate you for a month, and require you
to do a thousand lines of Virgil apiece for me within
the next fortnight.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Roylston,” Tony spoke up quickly, to prevent
Kit from uttering the ill-chosen words that he felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
were on his lips. “You are probably much misinformed
as to the facts, and if you will permit me to
say so, with entire respect, you have not asked us a
question. As for me, I would very much prefer that
you referred the matter to the Head as you suggested.”</p>

<p>For once in his life Mr. Roylston was at loss for
what to say. He looked at Tony as though he could
not believe the evidence of his senses. He started
to speak several times, and each time changed his
mind. Finally, he said, “I think that I am competent
to settle this matter without troubling Doctor Forester.
I warn you that refusal to do my impositions will
result in the usual penalties. Deliberate and prolonged
disobedience will subject you to suspension
or expulsion.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir,” said Tony.</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston turned thereupon, and with what
dignity he could muster, walked out.</p>

<p>“By Jove, Tony old boy, you got him. Bless you
for keeping me from blurting out. I’d have spoiled
it all.”</p>

<p>“Yes, kiddo, you certainly would. As a matter of
fact, you have not been specially impertinent, considering
the provocation; and what’s jolly well certain
is that Gumshoe doesn’t want the matter to get to
the Head. He knows who’s to blame, but he has it
in for us. Painful person, isn’t he? Virgil’ll rot
before I do his thousand lines or pay any attention
to his gating. I wish he would take us to the Head.
Well, I reckon Thornton will let Finch alone now.
Let’s find Jimmie, and go and wash the blood off in
the tank.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>So saying, they locked arms, and went singing “Up
above the school-topp’d hill” down the corridor. They
met Mr. Morris at the outer door of Standerland
House. “Well, you seem to be particularly frisky
this afternoon,” said he, “what’s up?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely nothing,” laughed Kit; “we’re just
two good pure innocent happy schoolboys. Come on,
magister; come for a dip with us in the tank.”</p>

<p>“Well, wait a second, while I stow sweater and
stick, and I’ll be with you.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="pch">A GATING AND A GAME</p>

<p>For the next few days Thornton’s thrashing was the
principal theme of the school talk. The story was told,
though no one knew whence it originated. Tony and
Kit dismissed it with a laugh or an exclamation, but
Finch, interrogated on all hands, gave a correct
version. Thornton and his friends kept themselves
in the background for a week or so, but nursed their
grudge with the dogged determination of ill-will,
and when occasion offered continued to torture Finch
on the sly, but not so brutally.</p>

<p>The chief satisfaction that Tony got out of the
incident, after the pleasure of thrashing a bully, was
his talk with the Head on the subject. “I hear,”
said Doctor Forester, as he stopped Deering after
Chapel one morning, “that there have been some
lively doings in Standerland of late, in the absence
of the masters.”</p>

<p>Tony, not yet sure of the Doctor’s attitude, blushed
and stammered something that was quite unintelligible.
The Head eyed him keenly. “For once,” he said,
laying his hand gently on the boy’s shoulder, “I am
not disposed to object to a somewhat vigorous method
of taking the law into your own hands. I fancy you
will have been successful in putting an end to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
brutal hazing to which young Finch has been subjected.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Tony. “We were a bit
rough and pretty generally out of order, but we hoped
the end justified the means.”</p>

<p>The Doctor smiled and went on.</p>

<p>Tony found Kit at the lobby outside the schoolroom,
and repeated the conversation in great glee.</p>

<p>“Great man, the Doctor!” remarked Kit, judiciously.
“Now I guess we’ll let the Gumshoe
whistle for his lines. What a relief it is occasionally
to meet with broad-mindedness on the part of those
who are charged with our education. Same with
the Gumshoe’s gating,” he added, in illogical parenthesis.</p>

<p>The opportunity to test Mr. Roylston’s whistling
powers came sooner than they expected. The day
before the Boxford game, Jack Stenton called off the
football practice, and had the school in to a mass-meeting
in the Gymnasium. The boys sang the
school songs with their traditional vigor, and listened
with the utmost good nature and appreciation to
speeches that in many cases had been delivered a
dozen times before. The Doctor remarked that it
was difficult to be original on such occasions, as though
he was making the remark for the first time; but at
the risk of repeating himself he did not mind saying
that they had supreme confidence in the prowess of
the team and that the school was confident of a victory
on the morrow. Stenton gave, in his matter of fact
way, impressing the boys deeply, a careful estimate
of the abilities of the different players and what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
might be expected of them in the game, and offered a
judicial estimate that the score would be two touch-downs
to none in favor of Deal. Billy Wendell,
the captain, stammered, in the traditional captain’s
manner, that the team wanted the school behind them,
and that&mdash;that was about all he had to say. Other
members of the faculty made remarks, some of which
were witty, some merely facetious, but all received
with wild applause. Then they sang some more,
cheered for the team, for the school, for Jack Stenton,
for Billy Wendell, and the meeting was concluded by
the Head declaring a half-holiday for the team, and
removing Monday Port bounds for the afternoon in
behalf of the two upper forms. Many of the boys had
friends coming on the afternoon trains, and counted
on this largess as a general permission to go in and
meet them.</p>

<p>Kit’s mother was coming, with a couple of girls.
Rooms for them had been taken at the Deal Inn on
the Port Road near the school. Immediately after
the mass-meeting Kit called to Tony, and asked
him to go in with him to the depôt and meet the five
o’clock train.</p>

<p>“Are we really going to break the Gumshoe’s
gating?” asked Tony.</p>

<p>“We certainly are,” responded Kit cheerfully. “To
heck with the Gumshoe; bounds are off for the afternoon
anyway. It’ll be a good way to get the matter
officially to the Head. By gum!” he exclaimed,
glancing toward the Schoolhouse, “Gumshoe’s got
call-over.”</p>

<p>Surely enough Mr. Roylston was standing on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Schoolhouse steps, with a long line of boys in single
file beneath him, waiting to report.</p>

<p>“Shall we tell him?” asked Kit.</p>

<p>“Guess we’ll have to,” answered Tony. “Let’s
butt in to the middle of the line for once, and get
it over.” Ordinarily, it may be remarked, Fifth
Formers did not report, unless they were going into
Monday Port. They made for the line, and Kit
grabbed a Third Form boy by the arm.</p>

<p>“Say, Bunting, do you mind letting us in here?
We’re in a big hurry.”</p>

<p>The small boy flushed with pleasure at the request
from such popular and distinguished persons as
Wilson and Deering, and readily made way. Mr. Roylston,
who seldom failed to see anything that was
going on around him, stopped for a moment and looked
at them with an expression of stern disapproval.
The boys thought that he was about to order them to
the end of the line, but for once he disappointed them,
and after a significant compression of his lips, went
on with the call-over. There was a general titter
along the line.</p>

<p>Soon it was Kit’s turn, and he was at Mr Roylston’s
side. The master held a paper in his hand, on which
was printed the school list. It was the duty of the
master of the day to note on such a slip opposite each
boy’s name the plans that he reported for the afternoon.</p>

<p>“Wilson and Deering, sir,” said Kit.</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston faced him. “Now that they have
usurped the places of a score or so of boys who were
in line before them, what do the Messrs. Wilson and
Deering propose to do in such a hurry?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“We are going to town, sir, to meet my mother who
is arriving on the five o’clock train.”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed!” said Mr. Roylston. “I am very
sorry to put Mrs. Wilson to any inconvenience, but
I fear I must do so. As you both are gated for the
month, it is impossible for me to acquiesce in your
ingenuous proposal.”</p>

<p>“Beg your pardon, sir,” said Kit, “but the Head
has declared bounds off for the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly,” commented Mr. Roylston, “but
I have had the unpleasant duty of gating you for a
month. Next!”</p>

<p>Wilson and Deering were swept on by the crowd.
Without further ado, they cut across the field, climbed
the stone wall and started across the meadows for
the town.</p>

<p>In Monday Port they loafed about until five o’clock,
when they went to the depôt and met Mrs. Wilson.
She was accompanied by two very pretty and attractive
girls, Betty, Kit’s sister, and Barbara Worthington,
her great friend and a boyish flame of Kit’s. The
party had a merry time on the drive out the Port
Road and a pleasant tea on the old-fashioned gallery
of the Inn, in the golden light of the Indian summer
afternoon. Absorbed in the unusual pleasure attendant
upon the presence of girls at Deal, they quite forgot
the predicament they were in with Mr. Roylston.</p>

<p>The master in charge had a better memory, and
was waiting for them at the entrance of the cloister
that led into the refectory, where the school was
gathering for supper. He was very angry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will trouble you,” he said, “to come with me
at once to the Head. You have been flagrantly disobedient.”</p>

<p>The boys followed him without a word across the
quadrangle to the Rectory.</p>

<p>“A very annoying case, Doctor Forester,” Mr. Roylston
began when they were closeted with the Head
in his study. “I gated Wilson and Deering for a
month, but despite my warning at call-over, they
deliberately ignored the gating and went to town this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“It was quite necessary, sir,” protested Kit, “that
I should meet my mother, who arrived at five o’clock.
Besides, sir, we think that Mr. Roylston’s gating was
unjust, and we asked him to refer the matter to you,
sir, and he refused.”</p>

<p>“That was not necessary,” said the Doctor, “except
under exceptional circumstances. However, I may
say that it is my general understanding that when
bounds are raised the day before the Boxford game,
that for the afternoon ordinary penalties and restrictions
are suspended. Why were they gated, sir?”</p>

<p>“For brutal conduct, Doctor Forester, to their
younger schoolmates.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear that,” said the Head, with
something like a smile flitting across his face. “You
behaved brutally toward smaller boys?” He faced
the culprits.</p>

<p>Tony smiled in spite of himself. “Why, yes, sir,
I suppose we did; we planned to.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear it,” said the Head. “But,
Mr. Roylston, for once let us compromise and temper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
justice with mercy. Only recently these two young
brutes did a very effective and commendable service
to the school,&mdash;they thrashed two bullies who had
been making the life of a small boy quite miserable.
Let us forgive them their brutality in the one case
for the sake of their brutality in the other, where
it was not undeserved. I am disposed to ask you to
dispense the gating and the penalties for violating it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston compressed his lips. “I&mdash;is it just,
sir?”</p>

<p>The Doctor smiled in his odd way. “I am disposed
to insist on your being merciful, Mr. Roylston. I
will guarantee that there will be no more brutality
nor disobedience. Let us threaten them with dire
penalties, if they are reported for brutality again.
Good-day, boys.”</p>

<p>As they went out, they heard the Doctor say in
suave and cheerful tones, “Stay and have a bit of
supper with me, Roylston.” “Thank you, no;”
answered the master, “I have duties immediately.
Good-evening, sir.”</p>

<p>“One for the Gumshoe,” said Tony blithely, as
they turned onto the campus.</p>

<p>Kit was serious. “I have always said,” he remarked
sententiously, “that the Gumshoe Ebenezer
was an odious ass; but I have always had, until this
moment, a sneaking conviction that in so saying I was
doing him an injustice. Henceforth my conscience
is absolved. Ass he is; ass he shall be.”</p>

<p>“Amen,” said Tony. “Fact is, Gumshoe’s had it in
for Finch. Mysterious beast, ain’t he! We score
to-day, kiddo, but the Gumshoe is not annihilated.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I dare say not. The possibilities of his getting
back at us are pretty nigh endless. But say, Tonio,
old sport, isn’t Bab Worthington a queen?”</p>

<p>“Quite the queen, Kitty; but Betty Wilson is no
mere handmaid.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother Betty; she’s a good sort. But let’s
hurry, so we can get down early. I am half sorry I
asked the crowd. Think I’d rather have&mdash;”</p>

<p>They both began to run then toward the dining-room,
where the school was already at supper.</p>

<p>That evening “the crowd,” as our friends called
themselves in their modest schoolboy way, including
Kit, Tony, Jimmie Lawrence, Teddy Lansing and
Tack Turner, went to the Inn and spent a merry
evening under Mrs. Wilson’s indulgent chaperonage.
There were other parties there, including the parents
and sisters and cousins and an occasional aunt of
various boys; a gathering of the clans loyal to Deal;
a score or so of Old Boys, mostly from Kingsbridge,
back for the game, who had overflowed from the
crowded school into the Inn. In the proud consciousness
of their undoubted superiority as college men,
the Old Boys somewhat cast their younger brethren in
the shade, and treated them with patronizing airs, asking
them occasional questions in a patriarchal manner.</p>

<p>Tony alone amongst his companions seemed to
shine that evening. There flashed into prominence,
to their first observation, in his manner, his appearance
even, something of that charm which was more and
more making him a favorite, and which, though his
schoolfellows never analyzed it, was to be cordially
recognized later on. It would have been hard to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
in just what Tony’s charm lay, perhaps it was that
a certain serious sweetness of disposition, the finer
traits of his character, for the most part unnoticed
in the helter-skelter rough-and-readiness of school
life, were emerging. Women, who are always quicker
than men to estimate a personality, to be conscious
of its finer as well as its more obvious strains, felt this
at once in Tony. He was a success with Mrs. Wilson
and the girls. His own friends, intimate with him in
all the openness and yet sometimes quite misleading
circumstances of everyday existence, who ordinarily
thought of him merely as a boon companion, a genial
playmate, gifted with a nice sense of honor but
ready for a lark and a risk with the most reckless,
were a little surprised at the evident impression he
made not only on Mrs. Wilson, but on Betty and
Barbara Worthington. His friends saw in him that
night a facility despite his modesty, a social poise
untempered by self-consciousness, that more distinctly
than ever before singled him out as their natural
leader. Kit indeed, felt several miserable pangs of
jealousy, as he noted Barbara’s quick response to
Tony’s gayety, and her unconcealed desire to remain
part of the group of which Tony was in some sense the
center rather than wander off with him for the too
obvious pleasure of a tête-à-tête. But Kit himself
was too whole-souled, too merry of nature, to sulk,
and save for an occasional growl to which no one paid
attention, before the evening was over, he was enjoying
Tony as he had never enjoyed him before,
wondering at the quick development of this social
side of his character which had been unobserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>As for Tony he was quite unconscious of anything
save that he was enjoying himself immensely; that
Betty Wilson was an extremely attractive girl, a
thoroughly “good sort,” as Kit had said; and that
he wished there were more frequent occasions when
the girls came to Deal. He was not sentimental, so
that he did not imagine that he had fallen in love.</p>

<p>The day of the game was a perfect one for football,
cool and gray, with no wind blowing. The teams were
in fine condition, and the Boxford boys, who had come
over in the old-time coach across the hills, looked
tremendously big and strong. Tony was still playing
end, the position to which he had been so unexpectedly
assigned in his Third Form year, and in which, through
no fault of his own, he had been the means of losing
the game. To be sure in the following year, when the
circumstances of that defeat had been made rather
generally clear, he had redeemed himself by good
playing and they had won, but he felt a keen desire
this year to blot out forever, if it might be, the bitter
memory of that first Boxford game. He wanted,
quite selfishly he told himself,&mdash;and perhaps he was
thinking a little of Betty&mdash;to win a game as definitely
as he had lost one.</p>

<p>As the team stepped out onto the field that afternoon,
resplendent in their red sweaters with the big
black D across the breast, and he sniffed the cool air
and heard the chorus of Deal cheers ring down the
lines, he lifted his head like a good hunter keen for
the chase, and a thrill of determination went through
him like a shiver. They must win!</p>

<p>Billy Wendell had the ball under his arm as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
came onto the field. Immediately he tossed it to Kit,
prominent to the spectators for his shock of yellow
hair and his bright red cheeks despite the fact that
this was his first appearance on the school team. Kit
tossed it to Barney Clayton, who muffed it, and then
made a quick dive and fell on it very much as a kitten
plays with a ball of yarn.... So for fifteen minutes or
so the preliminary practice went on, until the boys were
well warmed up for the strenuous work of the game.</p>

<p>Then came the shrill note of the referee’s whistle;
the two captains met in the center of the field; the
Boxford boy called and won the toss, and the two
teams trotted out to their places for the kick-off.
There were roars from the two grand-stands, the
antiphonal ringing-out of the Deal and Boxford cheers;
another blast from the referee’s whistle, and Kit,
who was playing center, gave the ball a kick that
sent it sailing down the field to within five yards of
the Boxford goal posts. A Boxford back caught it,
but Tony downed him in his tracks.</p>

<p>Then the teams lined up, the Boxford quarter
signaled to his full back for a line plunge, and in
less time than it takes to write it, the great hulk of
a six-foot boy went tearing through the Deal line.
Deal received a shock as great as it was unexpected.
They had foreseen no such smashing attack, and
before they could rally to the defense, they had been
forced for down after down over the smooth brown
field until the play was well in their own territory....</p>

<p>We do not mean to describe the game in detail, for
is it not written in the chronicles of the boys of Deal?
Wendell rallied his team just in time to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Boxford from scoring in the first half, when the ball
had been worried to within twenty yards of his goal.
Then followed an exchange of punts, which, as Edward
Clavering, Deal’s full back, could kick farther than his
opponent, gave Deal a slight advantage. When they
got the ball at last in the middle of the field, they
made a few gains by end runs. They were swifter,
more ingenious, better kickers than the Boxford boys,
but the team from over the hills had the advantage
in weight and strength.</p>

<p>During the intermission between the halves Stenton
did his best to hearten his boys, but it was a poor
best, for he felt pretty certain that they were bound
to be scored against heavily in the next half. They
could not stand the smashing of the line&mdash;already
Clayton and one or two others had been taken out.</p>

<p>The second half saw a repetition of the tactics of
the first. Boxford persistently hit the line, and within
five minutes of the play had scored the inevitable
touchdown. The enthusiasm of their supporters was
only a trifle dampened when they failed to kick the
goal. After that Deal worried them a good deal with
trick plays, and once after gaining a considerable
distance by an exceptionally long punt and a fumble,
they seemed within striking distance of the goal.
Clavering tried for a field goal, but to the sharp distress
of his supporters the ball went wide of the mark.
Boxford took the ball on their twenty-five yard line,
and renewed their demoralizing attack. Despite the
Deal boys’ desperate efforts, the ball was forced
back into their territory, straight down the field by
smashing center plays toward their goal. Poor Kit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
had been carried off, bruised and lame, but not seriously
hurt; the veteran Clavering had succumbed, and Deal
was left to finish the game with a team that was
half composed of substitutes. It was a question now,
it seemed, of simply keeping down the score.</p>

<p>Boxford fumbled, and again they escaped danger for
the moment. But soon the ball had been worried again
dangerously near their goal. Twenty-five, twenty, fifteen
yards&mdash;Tony measured the distance with grim despair.
Suddenly, as the Boxford quarter snapped back
the ball, something unexpected happened. Signals got
twisted,&mdash;at any rate, there was a fumble and a scrimmage,
and twenty boys were scrambling in a heap,
when the attention of the spectators was arrested by
the shrill cry of the Boxford quarter, for Tony Deering,
with the ball tucked under his arm, had emerged from
the mass of players, and was speeding like a frightened
deer down the field toward the Boxford goal.</p>

<p>The quarter made a desperate effort to intercept
him, but Tony dodged as quickly as lightning flashes,
and raced on with a clear field. The two teams,
recovered, were rushing after him.... One could
have heard a whisper from one side of the field to
the other so tense was the excitement. The silence
was absolute save for the pattering of the swift feet
upon the turf.... Then the cheers broke forth, for
Tony had planted the ball midway behind the goal
posts. For five minutes there was pandemonium on
the side lines, restrained for a moment, only to break
forth afresh as Clavering kicked the goal. The game
was won, for almost immediately after the kick-off,
the whistle blew, and the referee called “Time.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE NIGHT OF THE BONFIRE</p>

<p>If Tony had enjoyed the sensation of expanding
under appreciation the night before the game, it
reached fatigue point the night after. It falls to few
boys, even for so short a time, to be the hero of his
school; but it is one of the pleasantest experiences that
can befall him. It gives the hero a feeling of kinship
with the mighty conquerors of the past; a sense, intense
if fleeting, of being one with Alexander, with Cæsar,
with Napoleon. And though Deering bore his honors
modestly, for this once he enjoyed them to the full;
with the full-bloodedness of youth, he luxuriated in a
sense of satisfaction with the world in general and
with himself in particular. He was not ordinarily self-important,
but it would have been an inhuman boy
who remained indifferent to the incense of praise he
received after that Boxford game. To have turned
what seemed certain defeat into unexpected victory
was a piece of good luck for which he was grateful,
as well as he was grateful for the undoubted fact
that he could run faster than most boys of his age.</p>

<p>Immediately after the game a score of boys, rushing
across the lines, had laid bodily hold of him, hoisted
him on their shoulders; and with similar groups, who
had performed like service for other members of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
team, they marched off the field, singing the school
song at the top of their hoarse voices, in dreadful
tune but with an enthusiasm that atoned for all
defects. Jack Stenton was in the midst of them, and
he literally hugged Tony when the boys put him down
at the entrance to the Gymnasium locker-room.
“I’m glad it fell to you, young ‘un,” he said; “it was
a great run that will be remembered as long as boys
play football at Deal.”</p>

<p>After his shower Tony dressed, joined Kit and
Jimmie Lawrence, and wandered about the campus
with them, enjoying to the fullest the sensation of
universal proprietorship. At half-past six, they went
again to the Inn to dine with Mrs. Wilson and the girls.</p>

<p>Kit had a black eye and a swollen nose that hurt
considerably, but which he would not have foregone
for the world; they made him feel as well as look a
martyr to the cause. The girls were beaming, quite
unaffectedly proud to be the guests of such heroes.
Kit’s bruises seemed to affect Miss Worthington rather
as ornaments than otherwise, to lend a fascination
not afforded by his natural good looks, for she acquiesced
this time in the pairing off on the way to
the school after the dinner, for the celebration, that
afforded him an opportunity for the much desired
tête-à-tête. Mrs. Wilson appropriated Jimmie, so
that Tony and Betty were left to walk together.</p>

<p>Alone with him, Betty ceased to beam; in fact,
became shy and unwontedly silent. Tony liked the
shyness, thought her sweeter so. He felt a pronounced
sentimental thrill as he gave her his hand to help her
across an insignificant ditch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“It must be wonderful,” she said at last to break
the awkward silence, “it must be wonderful to win
a game.”</p>

<p>“It is,” Tony laughed ingenuously. “Do you
know, Miss Wilson, I feel half ashamed of myself.
I so hoped something like that might happen. I
suppose a fellow ought to think of the game and the
school, and I reckon most of ‘em do; but two years
ago, I was the means of our losing the Boxford game,
and I tell you it took me a long time to get over the
feeling that gave me.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Betty. “Kit has told me about
that.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was a long time ago; but I never did
really get over it.”</p>

<p>“But it wasn’t your fault,” protested Betty.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, in a sense it was; if I had stuck to the
ball tighter, I reckon it wouldn’t have happened.
But that sort of made me feel that I wanted a special
chance to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, you got it,” said the girl, with a smile. “Of
course, one cannot help wanting to do things one’s
self. I suppose we are all a little bit selfish.”</p>

<p>They chatted on then more at ease, until they
reached the great field behind the Chapel where the
celebration was to take place.</p>

<p>Every light in the school building was blazing, and
a line of Chinese lanterns had been strung to fine
effect up and down the driveway and along the terraces.
In the center of the playing-field back of the
school an enormous bonfire had been constructed,
of drygoods boxes, barrels, fence rails, and various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
other combustibles, including an untenanted chicken-house
that an amateur farmer of the Second Form
had contributed in a genuine spirit of sacrifice.
Around the bonfire were gathered three hundred boys
of the school, a score or so of the masters and many
of the Old Boys and friends who had stayed over.
On the outskirts of the crowd there was a complement
of sundry enthusiastic country urchins, who for the
night had buried the proverbial hatchet usually in
play between them and the school, and were rejoicing
lustily in the honor that had fallen upon the
entire community.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Wilson’s party arrived, Billy Wendell
applied a match to a mass of kerosene-soaked excelsior,
and the flames started up the pile with an
avidity, it seemed, that was impelled by sympathy
with the mounting spirits of the boys. A dozen
rockets were fired off simultaneously, three hundred
Roman candles were exploded, and a score of red
fires were lighted in various parts of the field. There
was a sudden blaze of splendid light.</p>

<p>Soon the magnificent bonfire dominated the interest.
The boys circled about it, hand in hand, shouting,
cheering, singing. The school bells rang out joyously
on the frosty night; the strains of the school songs
echoed and re-echoed, until was caught up in full
chorus by those hundreds of happy voices, the
triumphal song,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pphq8 p1">“Palms of victory, palms of glory.”</p>

<p class="p1">Finally they hoisted Billy Wendell, the captain,
up on the wooden rostrum that was brought out on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
such occasions; and after more wild and intense
cheering when the cheer leaders had sunk back almost
exhausted by their efforts, they gave him a chance to
speak. “Fellows,” said Billy, with not more than the
usual oratorical grace but with an effect that many a
trained orator might have envied, “Fellows, I guess
we’re all glad we won. I can’t make a speech; and
anyway there’s some one else here to whom our
victory to-day really is due. And I move we have
Tony Deering up here, and tell him what we think of
him.”</p>

<p>Frantic howls as Billy leaped down, and a dozen
boys hustled Tony with rough-and-ready good will
up to the rostrum, paying absolutely no attention
to his protests. Tony’s presence of mind quite deserted
him as he faced the encircling crowd of eager,
flame-brightened faces,&mdash;also the feeling that there
was anything heroic in being a hero. As they cheered
and cheered him to the echo, he had a moment in
which to gather his wits. “Fellows,” he said at
last, when the crowd had become quiet, “I’m mighty
grateful for the way in which you’ve treated me.
But I don’t deserve it. The ball popped into my
arms in the scrimmage, and I just ran. Any other
fellow would have done the same. What really won,”
he added, “was that the team had made a good defense
against a whirlwind attack at critical moments. And
that’s the reason that when we got a chance to score,
it meant a victory. Ned Clavering scored the winning
point by kicking the goal.”</p>

<p>With that he jumped down, struggled through the
crowd, and slipped unobserved to the outskirts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the circle. Other boys were being elevated to the
rostrum, so that attention was diverted from him.
For himself, his heart was full, and for the moment
he wanted to be alone.</p>

<p>He could not hear the speeches from where he stood,
but the scene was before him like the stage at a play.
Suddenly he noticed, standing quite near him, apart
from the jubilant crowd, the lonely, pathetic little
figure of the despised Finch. The boy was gazing
at Tony intently, with an expression of pathetic
admiration, the self-forgetting admiration sometimes
experienced when we behold a noble or a fine action
in which we have had no part, of which we are incapable.
There was longing in the boy’s pale watery
little eyes, and his mouth was twisted out of shape,
as though it were not fashioned to express the unwonted
emotions that stirred his soul. As Tony
glanced at him, with a flash of intuition, it seemed
to him that he thoroughly understood the half-starved
soul of Jacob Finch, his pathetic and terrible loneliness,
his unreasoned terrors of life, his ardent unsatisfied
longings for the boyish friendliness and companionship
about him in which he had no part.... Involuntarily
Tony moved toward him, and obeying an impulse
quite devoid of that repulsion that Finch usually
stirred in him, he threw his arm carelessly over the
boy’s shoulder. “It’s a great sight, kid; ain’t it?”
he said.</p>

<p>Finch was trembling as if he had a chill. His eyes
glanced for a moment into Tony’s intensely, then
shifted, and he answered in a queer hoarse tone, “I
‘spose so. I dunno.” And then he added, fiercely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
“But I’m glad&mdash;I’m <i>glad you</i> made that run.” The
next instant, as if his own speech had frightened him,
he shook Tony’s arm from his shoulder, and slipped
away into the shadows. Tony saw him no more that
night.</p>

<p>“Poor kid!” he thought, and his eyes filled with
tears. He had seen unhappiness before, in his own
home, and the memory of it was bitter. Here at
school he had forgotten it all; the world had seemed
a bright and a happy place, and he was happy in it.
Poor Finch brought back to him intensely the realization
that life was not altogether as free from care, as
full of affection and kindness and joy, as this gay
scene and jubilant celebration would indicate. There
was bitterness in the thought, and yet, in a way, he
was not sorry it had come. It seemed to him now
that for the last few days he had been absolutely
absorbed in himself, in fact that he had been living
self-absorbed for a long time; that despite his generous
words from the rostrum, what he had really been glad
of in the victory was, that it had been so largely due
to him.</p>

<p>Suddenly he gave the tree against which he was
standing a vigorous kick. What a fool he was! to be
silly with delight at winning a football game when
just across the hall from him there lived such livid
boyish misery!</p>

<p>At length he resought his companions, and when
at last the celebration was over, and the great blazing
pile of the bonfire had collapsed, he walked back
again with Kit’s party to the Inn. Both Betty and
he were quieter now than before. She was shy again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and this time he could think of nothing to say. Their
commonplaces about the celebration fell flat.</p>

<p>“You are going to-morrow?” he asked abruptly,
as they turned into the grounds of the Inn.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, “quite early. Bab and I
are at school too, you know?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. I wish I could see you sometimes....”</p>

<p>“Well, can’t you?... You’ll be coming home
with Kit some holiday.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I will. I hope so.” He was silent for a
moment, then with a strange shyness, he said, “Will
you&mdash;will you give me those violets?”</p>

<p>Betty was silent. She hesitated for a moment, then
unpinned the violets from her dress, and gave them
to him. Their hands met in the dark, and fluttered
in a little clasp for the moment. Then Tony slipped
the violets into his pocket. They were at the Inn
steps, and to the surprise of all, he declined to come
in, but bade them good-bye there.</p>

<p>Instead of going back to the school, he struck across
the meadows to the beach. It had cleared at nightfall,
and the stars were shining in a deep blue sky, and a
lovely young crescent moon, cloud-clung, hung in the
west. Tony walked up the beach alone, thinking,
feeling intensely. The silent somber beauty of the
night, the great stars, the lazy splash of the little
foam-flecked waves upon the sands, the cool frosty
dark, appealed to him deeply. He could scarcely
have told of what he was thinking: of various things&mdash;the
day’s events, the celebration, Betty and the violets
she had given him, Finch and his hungry eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
life. The world seemed beautiful to him, but strange
and sad.... Years afterward he was to recall that
night, and remember that it had marked a definite
moment in the process of his coming to himself.</p>

<p>At the end of the beach he met Mr. Morris, who was
also walking alone. “Hello,” exclaimed the master,
“what are you doing here? The conqueror is tired
of plaudits, eh?”</p>

<p>“What brings <i>you</i>, magister?... I wanted to be
alone I guess.”</p>

<p>“And I,” said Morris, with a smile. “Sometimes
a day of excitement reacts on me like this. I need
to round it off with a walk by myself. Let’s go back
together though, if you have had enough of yourself
as I have.”</p>

<p>“Quite enough,” said Tony, as he turned with the
older man back toward the school.</p>

<p>For a while they said nothing, but eventually the
master, by tactful questions, led the boy to talk of
himself. There followed one of those long quiet conversations
that come so rarely, but mean so much
to boy and master when they come. When they
reached the school all of the lights were out save for
a glow at the spot where the bonfire had been. They
shook hands and parted at the door of Morris’s study.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster, when he was alone, instead of
lighting his lamp, stood for a long while before the
glowing embers of the fire on his hearth, absorbed
in his thoughts. He had had a bad day, a stupid
day after the excitement of the game, for there had
come upon him one of those unaccountable and unreasonable
moods of depression wherein it seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
him that he was wasting his life in the obscurity
of a petty profession, wasting the talents, abilities,
ambitions, that in college days had promised a
brilliant career. He knew it was but a mood, but he
had not been able to shake it off. Other fellows,
classmates of his at school and college, had been back,
with their good-natured, ill-chosen greetings that drove
the iron deeper into his soul: “Old Morris&mdash;holding
the fort&mdash;still on the old camp-ground, eh?” and the
like.</p>

<p>As he stood before his dying fire that night, he
recalled the mood of the afternoon and marveled to
realize that it was gone. He asked himself the reason
for its going, but he knew the answer. He knew in
his heart that the best he was, the best he could be,
counted here at Deal as much, perhaps, more, than it
could count elsewhere; and that it counted despite
the obscurity, despite the lack of recognition where
he would so keenly have valued it, from those who
had expected good things from him in days gone by.
And he knew that the real compensation was in the
response he got from, the stimulus he gave to, boys
like Tony Deering. Once in a while it was given him
to see the meaning of his life, as in a vision. He knew
to-night, as perhaps he had never definitely put it to
himself before, that he would stay on at Deal for good
and all, give his best, not only for a time as for years
he had somehow supposed it would only be, but his
best for as long as he lived....</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SPECTACLE</p>

<p>Games and girls fortunately are but interludes in
schoolboy life. Were it otherwise, it is to be feared
that the specific objects for which boys are sent away
from home during such valuable years would receive
but little of their attention. There were to be no
more games, except indoor baseball and fives, until the
hockey season which rarely set in before the Christmas
holidays.</p>

<p>The little group of boys, whose fortunes we have
been following, were not particularly interested in
indoor baseball, except Jimmie, whose athletic achievements
had been altogether on the diamond in the
spring. And it was well they were not, for studies
had been suffering during the football season, and at
the exams, which came the week following the Boxford
game, both Tony and Kit found that they were
standing lower in the school than they had ever stood
before. Judicious advice from the Head and a sharp
letter from old General Deering, who, though he was
proud of Tony’s athletic honors, regarded them as
no substitute for scholastic achievements, kept him
pretty closely at his books.</p>

<p>As for girls, he and Betty exchanged a few rather
commonplace letters, but as the keen-eyed mistress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
at Betty’s school soon detected the nature of her
correspondence, their letters were few and far between.
At the Christmas holidays Tony went home with
Kit to the Wilson country place on Long Island, and
spent there a glorious three weeks. But, it might
as well be said at once, that though Tony and Betty
became the best of friends, the sentiment that had
accented their walks together the night of the game
at Deal, died a natural death. School and its varied
interests absorbed Deering and left him little time or
opportunity for love affairs.</p>

<p>During the winter he became interested in the
Dealonian, a semi-secret society, that held frequent
debates and discussions before the school, and regarded
itself as being an institution of great importance.
For exercise and sport he went in for hockey, where
his fleetness counted as much toward success as it
did in football. The Deal boys had capital hockey
grounds, one on Deal Water which lay at the foot
of the hill between the school and Monday Port; and
the other on Beaver Pond, under the lee of Lovel’s
Woods which though smaller usually froze earlier.</p>

<p>It was customary for the Dealonian to elect a
Fifth Former as its president at the beginning of the
winter term. This office was supposed, and usually
did, register the boys’ somewhat premature choice
for a head prefect for the school for the following year.
Deering was elected president of the Dealonian by
a unanimous vote, after very little campaigning on
the part of his friends. He was generally popular,
and his exploit in the Boxford game had brought him
more prominently before the school than ever before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
In the opinion of his particular friends he was also
developing qualities of leadership, which made him
the logical candidate of their group for general honors.
Tony valued the position of president highly. And
in the fine fervor of his good resolutions he determined
that through it he would do a lot for the
school. The Dealonian held frequent meetings at
which the entire school were invited, and at which
topics of general interest were discussed by the boys
themselves. It was indeed through these meetings
that the public opinion of the school was largely
formed and guided by the older boys.</p>

<p>The walk with Mr. Morris on the beach the night
of the Boxford game had solidified in Tony’s mind
a good many resolutions. And, though it is not
usually the case that the generous ideals and ambitions
of boys find particular expression, since the flash of
intuition into Finch’s starved life had been in part
the occasion of his forming good resolutions at all,
it was not unnatural that he should have settled upon
Finch as a concrete opportunity for putting them
into effect. The talk with Mr. Morris, though Finch’s
name had not actually been mentioned, had also
brought the matter before Tony’s mind, for Morris
had been the first to suggest to him the possibility
of his being of use in that direction. To be sure, the
sympathy with Finch had been intuitive and had not
stayed with him as vividly as it had impressed him
on the night of the bonfire, but then it had flashed so
intensely that it was not soon altogether to expire.
It glowed in the depths of his consciousness like
sparks amongst the embers of a dying fire, capable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of blazing forth again if fresh fuel should be added.
Tony proposed to add the fuel.</p>

<p>He made a point, for instance, of dropping in at
Finch’s room in Standerland two or three times a
week and chatting with the boy the odd quarters
of an hour that he otherwise would have spent in
genial loafing with his cronies. And though he certainly
would not have kept on going there for the
sake of anything that Finch could contribute to the
joy of life for him, when the awkwardness of deliberately
performing a kindness had somewhat worn off,
he found a certain amount of compensating satisfaction
in noting the light of pleasure that came into
Jake’s pale blue eyes, and in the relaxation of the
corners of his mouth from bitter rigidity into friendly
appreciation and welcome. Gradually too Finch’s
shyness wore off a little when he was alone with Tony;
and though it can hardly be said that even in his
most un-selfconscious moments he ever seemed a full-blooded
care-free boy, he thawed into a semblance of
humanity. He reminded Tony often of a dog that
has been treated cruelly in its puppyhood, which never
recovers fearlessness but shrinks even under a friendly
hand.</p>

<p>And like a dog Jacob Finch began to idolize Anthony
Deering. This was the first time in all his
barren life that a fellow boy had treated him with
kindness, who had not showed in his manner the
repulsion the unhappy little chap had the misfortune
to stir in his kind. Tony’s image loomed large in his
thoughts. The intense worship he paid him secretly
did much to atone for the slights of others, to blot out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
other boys from his consciousness. He cringed and
shrank still under jibes and jokes, trembled with
unreasoned fear before masters, quivered with fright
when he found himself alone in a crowd of boys;
but he did his work faithfully and with the success
that comes from persistence even when a keen intelligence
is lacking. More and more, however, his
inner life was absorbed in his devotion to Deering.</p>

<p>From his seat in the chapel he could just see the
wavy, copper-colored top of Tony’s head. By straining
a little he could frequently see his face,&mdash;bright,
sensitive, mobile, smiling often that smile of a singular
and rare sweetness that made Tony beautiful
to others beside Finch. To Jake he was as perfect, as
spotless, as wonderful, as a god. The fervor of his
adoration was akin to the enthusiasm of a <i>devotée</i>
for his idol. All this of course he hid, not altogether
but mostly, from Deering; never voiced, though he
could not help looking his devotion. He would spend
hours during a day standing about in various places
on the mere chance that he would get a glimpse of
Tony; haunted the woods above Beaver Pond in
the hockey season, where he would lie, flat and shivering,
upon a projecting rock, and follow with weak,
straining eyes the skaters on the ice below, his eager
gaze seeking always for one bright slim form. And
when he had found it, he was as happy as he often had
been.</p>

<p>Even Tony’s friends occupied but a small place
in Finch’s consciousness. He was grateful to Kit
for his protection against Ducky Thornton and his
gang of tormentors, but the only real admiration he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
had for Kit was because he possessed qualities&mdash;Finch
could not have named them&mdash;that had induced Tony
to choose him for a friend.</p>

<p>Occasionally Tony and Jimmie would have their
<i>protégé</i> in Number Five study, but on these occasions
Finch seemed to suffer so much from shyness that they
did not long attempt to repeat them.</p>

<p>Mr. Morris watched the process with inward approval
and outward indifference. His own advances
toward Finch had been received in a manner that gave
him little encouragement. He was sorry for the boy,
and he was proud of Tony’s efforts to help him on
and bring him out, but even his sanguine optimism
and unselfish good will failed to convince itself that
the Head had been wise in bringing Finch to Deal.
As for Doctor Forester, with the best intentions
in the world, he had few opportunities of seeing the
boy intimately, and he trusted absolutely to Morris
as being the one who could do the most and the best
for him.</p>

<p>Number Five study Standerland had become during
the winter term the sanctum of a privately published
and privately circulated magazine, issued weekly
as a rule, in pamphlet form under the title of <i>The
Spectacle</i>. The inspiring genius, editor-in-chief, business
manager, printing department and reportorial
staff was Jimmie Lawrence. Jimmie had always
had a literary turn, and usually had received A’s
for his weekly themes in English from Jack Stenton,
who combined with athletic prowess a genuine appreciation
for good literature. In addition to required
work for the masters he had written yards of short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
stories, poems, plays, essays and the like for the waste-paper
basket and his secret scrap-book. Jimmie was
likewise a great reader and he had taken more kindly
than the majority of his classmates to the Sir Roger
de Coverly papers from <i>The Spectator</i> that Stenton
had inflicted on the Fifth Form that year. He was
able to appreciate the genial sympathy and quiet
humor of the Eighteenth Century essayists, and more
than once he had dipped his pen in ink to attempt
a crude imitation of them. Practice improved his
style. He had himself a fund of subtle humor that
was becoming more and more evident as he matured,
for it was a humor that had found little opportunity
for expression in the crude horseplay and practical
joking of the Lower School.</p>

<p>One afternoon as he was planning an essay in the
Addisonian vein and style, it suddenly occurred to
him that there was a fund of material for such treatment
in the actual world about him. He chose little
Beverly, a fledgeling master, cock-sure and sophomoric,
as the subject for his first serious essay in the comic,
and achieved, in his own opinion, such a success that
he read his paper that evening to Tony.</p>

<p>“By Jove, Jim, that’s a joy!” was his room-mate’s
gratifying criticism. “That’s a blame sight better
than the sawdust that Jack is trying to stuff down our
throats in English.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have me doubts as to that,” Jimmie
responded, “but I appreciate the compliment even
if it makes the critic out to be an ignoramus.”</p>

<p>“Words of one syllable, my dear,” protested
Tony, “when you try to get ideas into my cranium.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Critic or not, that’s darn good writing. Give us
another.”</p>

<p>Jimmie smiled, closed his mathematics books with
the air of one who makes a sacrifice in a noble cause,
and for half an hour bent again to laborious composition.
The result was a clever little skit on Ducky
Thornton entitled “The Human Sofa Cushion.” The
wit was broader, and it struck Tony as quite irresistibly
funny.</p>

<p>“By Jove, kiddo, we’ll start a <i>Spectator</i> of our own,
eh? Hit off the masters and some of our loving schoolmates,
and let ‘em circulate. It’ll be heaps of fun.”</p>

<p>Lawrence laughed at the vision of the possibilities
that came to him. “I think it will,” he said. “We’ll
write ‘em out in your clear hand, and pass ‘em on to
the crowd.”</p>

<p>And so <i>The Spectacle</i> came into existence. Jimmie
did most of the composition, and Tony invariably
copied it out, for Jimmie’s handwriting left much
to be desired, as is the case we have been told with
other authors. Now and then there was an original
contribution from Tony, and occasionally one from
Charlie Gordon, Teddy Lansing or Tack Turner, all
more crude and broad, but few absolutely devoid of
real humor. In the course of a few months they had
composed quite a gallery of pen-portraits, wherein
were caricatured, seldom unkindly, the faults and
foibles of most of the faculty and many of the boys.
<i>The Spectacle</i> had a popular if restricted circulation.</p>

<p>It fell to Tony at length to do the paper on Mr. Roylston.
None of the articles were labeled by correct
names, but there was scarcely ever any doubt in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
mind of the reader who had served as the model of
the portrait. The paper on Mr. Roylston, paraphrasing
his nickname, was entitled “Soft-toed Samuel.”
Tony had caricatured broadly, but before being
written out in his neat fine hand, the style had been
softened, smoothed and improved, occasional lapses
in orthography had been corrected, and the defects
of punctuation supplied,&mdash;in fact the crude strokes
of the amateur had been retouched by the hand of an
artist. The artist was Jimmie.</p>

<p>It was a great success with the <i>habitués</i> of Number
Five study. Tony was so pleased with it himself,
that he took it in late of an evening to Finch’s room
with the idea of cheering up his charge who had seemed
even unwontedly seedy that day.</p>

<p>“Here, Jake,” he exclaimed, as he burst in at
the door, “here’s the latest <i>Spectacle</i>. Have a try
at it.”</p>

<p>Finch was lying on his couch, laid low by an intense
headache. The pain was so severe that he could
scarcely respond to his hero’s greeting. “Thanks,”
he said weakly. He tried to get up, but Tony, quick
as a flash, pushed him gently back.</p>

<p>“There, keep quiet! I didn’t know you had another
headache. I’m awfully sorry, old chap. Rotten things,
those headaches of yours.”</p>

<p>Finch smiled, and writhed with pain. “It’ll be
all right, I guess.”</p>

<p>Tony sat down on the edge of the bed. “Why don’t
you go up to the Infirmary?... Can I get you anything?”</p>

<p>“No ... thank you,” Jake answered. “I’ll sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
it off; it’s the only way. Don’t bother. If you don’t
mind, I’ll make out better alone.”</p>

<p>“Mind? No. Only I’m blamed sorry.”</p>

<p>“Leave the <i>Spectacle</i>, will you?”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll stick it here on your desk. Read
it in the morning. Don’t forget to call me if you
want anything. Does Bill know you’re sick?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;he’s been in.”</p>

<p>“Well, good-night, Jake. Tell me what you think
of it to-morrow.”</p>

<p>When Tony had gone out, Finch tried to get up
and read the paper, but the pain pulled him back
on his bed again, and he lay there in misery till sleep
came at last and released him.</p>

<p>The next morning, with the hurry of breakfast
and chapel, he had no opportunity of reading the
squib until First Study, which, as Mr. Roylston held
it, usually was <i>study</i> and not the loafing, letter-writing,
novel-reading period it occasionally was under laxer
masters. Finch, who had hard work to keep the
place he was determined to maintain in the school,
rarely wasted his study periods, so that he was ignorant
of the various devices whereby the lazy gave the
pretense of studying when they were doing other
things. At the risk of an imperfect Greek lesson&mdash;for
he could restrain his curiosity no longer, he took
out Tony’s manuscript soon after First Study began,
and was eagerly and hastily perusing it. Deering’s
obvious exaggerations, and even more, though he
could not distinguish them, Jimmie’s finer touches,
amused him greatly. For the first time he was really
smiling broadly in the schoolroom. The master, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
long the traditional <i>bête noir</i> and subject of caricature,
took form in his imagination, and Mr. Roylston,
whom Finch feared with an abject fear, for once seemed
to him to be amusing.</p>

<p>Suddenly, to his intense horror, Gumshoe Ebenezer
stood before him, not in the spirit but in the flesh,
and his long slim bony fingers closed about Tony’s
manuscript as he removed it quickly from Finch’s
nerveless grasp.</p>

<p>“I will relieve you of that extraneous matter,” he
observed sharply. “It is expected that boys shall
spend this period in study, not in reading amusing
letters.”</p>

<p>“It&mdash;it isn’t a l&mdash;letter,” gasped Finch.</p>

<p>“It does not in the least matter whether it is a letter
or not,” replied Mr. Roylston. “It is very evident
that it has no bearing whatever upon Xenophon’s
<i>Anabasis</i> or the Greek Grammar.”</p>

<p>He glanced at the title as he spoke. “Soft-toed
Samuel” conveyed little to him, enough however to
inform him that he had been correct in his surmise
that it was tabooed matter.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but, it&mdash;it isn’t mine,” protested Finch.</p>

<p>“No?” commented Mr. Roylston, with an accent
of indifference. “I shall return it to its owner in
good time, if you choose to inform me who he is.”
He glanced casually over the writing.</p>

<p>“Don’t&mdash;don’t you dare to read that!” cried Finch,
his face livid, as for the moment anger got the better
of fear. “I’ll&mdash;I’ll&mdash;” he half rose from his seat, his
fists clenched in helpless rage.</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston turned upon him with a glare. “You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
will do what?” he asked in tones that almost robbed
Finch of his senses. “Get to work,” he added, after
looking at him steadily for a moment; and then turned
away, leaving his victim morally and spiritually prostrate.</p>

<p>Poor Finch sank back in his seat, bent his head,
and fastened his unseeing eyes on the pages of the
<i>Anabasis</i>. The incident, though observed and heard
by the whole schoolroom, seemed not to have created
a ripple of excitement. Not a sound disturbed the
stillness of the room. As the master turned from
Finch, he observed a hundred heads bent diligently
over their books, and a slight grim smile of satisfaction
crossed his face. He felt that he had reason to be
proud of his discipline. He seated himself at the desk,
and his eyes fell idly upon the first page of the manuscript.
“Soft-toed Samuel,” he read, and a curl
of contempt trembled along his thin lips. And then:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“There is no place of general resort in the school which is immune
from the presence of Soft-toed Sam; sometimes he is seen
thrusting his head even into the locker-rooms below stairs and
listening with eager and suspicious ear to the slang and careless
conversation that is apt to take place there. And woe to the boy
whose tongue is not restrained on such occasions! there will be a
day of reckoning. Sometimes he munches a bit of cake at the Pie-house,
making pretense of joviality; but whilst he seems attentive
to nothing but his goody and the Pie-lady, he overhears the remarks
of every boy in the place, and makes a note of them in his
little book. Sometimes he comes into the general assembly of all
the boys on a Sunday evening, as one who comes to hear and to
improve, but who leaves to carp. His face is too well-known, too
often seen by every boy in the school. The stealthy tread of Soft-toed
Samuel is ever on the trail of the lazy, the indifferent and the
wicked, and where he does not find matter for condemnation provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
him by nature, he creates it out of nothing. The Head
has....”</p>

<p class="p1">Mr. Roylston turned the pages, and glanced at the
conclusion.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Thus he lives in the school as a critic of and a bane to mankind
rather than as one of the species.”</p>

<p class="p1">It was enough. The handwriting, of course, he
recognized. He folded the paper neatly and placed
it in his pocket.</p>

<p>Poor Finch meanwhile was undergoing excruciating
agonies. Not a line of the Greek penetrated his
consciousness, even the familiar <i>ἐντεῦθεν ἐξελαῦναι</i>
was to him as the inscription on a Babylonian tablet.
His own careless folly and stupidity had brought about
a catastrophe, a frightful situation, in which he could
see his hero was apt to suffer more grievously than
himself. But in reality that was not possible. Finch
was suffering vicariously with an intensity that Tony
could never realize, that in such connection he could
never share.</p>

<p>And at the end of the period he fearfully approached
the master’s desk. As though divining the
petition trembling on his lips, Mr. Roylston bade
him sternly go out with his form, adding sharply, “I
shall return the paper myself when I have had the
opportunity of enjoying its promising humor.”</p>

<p>At recess Finch found Deering eating his bit of
luncheon in the Fifth Form common room. He drew
him aside.</p>

<p>“Well, Jake, headache gone?” began Tony. “What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
did you think of the Soft-toed Sammy? Why, what’s
the matter?”</p>

<p>Finch was white as a sheet. “Oh, Deering,” he
gasped, “an awful thing has happened. I&mdash;I was
reading it&mdash;like a fool&mdash;in First Study&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;Mr.
Roylston swiped it.”</p>

<p>Tony paused in the midst of taking a bite from his
bun, and looked at Jake in consternation.</p>

<p>“Gumshoe swiped it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Deering.... I’m sorry.... You don’t
know ... I wish I was dead.” He leaned against
the lintel of the doorway and hid his face in his hands.</p>

<p>Tony pulled himself together with an effort. “I
guess you’ve done me,” he began. Then, as he saw
Finch wince under his words, he went over quickly
to his side, and put his hand on his shoulder. “There,
cheer up; I was a beast to say that. It’s all my own
fault. It was a darn fool stunt to write such things.”</p>

<p>After a time he calmed the unhappy lad, and got
from him the details of the incident. At last he went
off to report the matter to Jimmie.</p>

<p>Lawrence naturally was inclined to say harsh things
of Finch, but he too realized that they themselves
were to blame for the predicament.</p>

<p>“Hate to deprive you of the honor, old chap,” he
said, “but honesty forbids me deny the authorship
and responsibility for <i>The Spectacle</i>. The horse is
on me.”</p>

<p>“The horse!” exclaimed Tony. “It will be a ton
of bricks. But it’s rot, Jimmie, to say you’re responsible.
I’ll be hanged if I think sticking an adjective
here and there, sprinkling commas about,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and tinkering with a few mixed tenses, makes you the
author. ‘Tis true it’s but a beastly paraphrase on
Addison,&mdash;but ‘twas my best and, so to speak, my
own.”</p>

<p>They waited somewhat anxiously that day for the
dreaded summons to Mr. Roylston’s outraged presence,
but it did not come. That night on his way to Standerland
from a meeting of the Dealonian, Tony found
a sealed packet in his letter-box in the Old School.
It was directed to him in Mr. Roylston’s minute
slanting chirography. He tore it open, and found
that it contained the confiscated copy of <i>The Spectacle</i>
and a note from the master therein caricatured.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I return to you under cover,” it ran, without address, “the
manuscript for which, since it is in your handwriting, I presume
you are responsible. It was confiscated from Finch in First Study
this morning. I have read it enough to suggest that the wisest
course will be for you to destroy this piece of scurrility at once,
also any copies of it that may exist. I have only to say that the
offense is so deep and gratuitous an insult that it is not punishable
by any of the ordinary methods at our command. Vain as the
supposition sometimes seems, we proceed at Deal School on the
assumption that we have to treat with gentlemen and the sons of
gentlemen.</p>

<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">E. Roylston.</span>”</p>

<p class="p1">As he read this note, Tony by turns went hot and
cold. The last sentence stung him to the quick. He
was intensely angry, but as the first impulse of rage
passed away, he realized with a bitter sense of humiliation
that the master had a perfect right to his resentment;
that for once he, Tony Deering, was absolutely,
hopelessly in the wrong. Alas! while he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
fondly supposing that he was beginning to live more
unselfishly, beginning to do more for others than he
had ever done before, he had wantonly wounded and
grossly insulted, as a result of indulging in his propensity
to make fun, a fellow member of the school.
With the shame and repentance warm in his heart,
he hurried over to Howard House where Mr. Roylston
roomed, and knocked at his door.</p>

<p>The master looked up from his desk, as Tony entered,
and his face hardened into a severe expression
as he waited for his visitor to speak.</p>

<p>“Sir,” exclaimed Tony, impulsively, “I’ve come
to beg your pardon.... I know I have done an
inexcusable thing, but I am sorry&mdash;&mdash;.”</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston laid his pen down and looked fixedly
at the boy, but the muscles of his face did not relax.
“Don’t you think, Deering,” he interrupted coolly,
“that your apology comes with a bad grace after
the offense is accidentally discovered? Apparently
the despicable character of your method of poking
fun seems only to occur to you when you are in danger
of incurring the just penalty of such conduct.”</p>

<p>Tony bit his lips, but he felt he deserved what the
master chose to say. He would not spoil his apology
by showing resentment. “I dare say it seems to you
that way, sir. But I can only say that at first I simply
saw the amusing side of it, and that it was not until
I thought how it must have seemed to you that I
realized it was an unkind caricature.”</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston perceptibly sniffed at the word
<i>caricature</i>. “Gratuitous insult, it were better termed,”
he ejaculated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, sir, I can’t undo it ... I only wish I could.
I apologize to you, sir, ... unreservedly.”</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston appeared to choose his words with
even more than his usual care. “I accept the apology,
of course, technically. But naturally it does not atone
for the offense.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Tony, “I know it does not.”</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence. “You are curious
to know what I propose to do?” asked Mr. Roylston,
with a note of sarcasm.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no, sir,” replied Tony ingenuously. “I
don’t think that matters, sir. I only hope you believe
what I say, that I am truly sorry for what has occurred.”</p>

<p>He had worded his sentence unfortunately, for the
master took it as a quibble. “Yes,” he replied tartly,
“I can well believe that you are sorry for what has
<i>occurred</i>.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean&mdash;&mdash;” began Tony.</p>

<p>“That will do,” said Mr. Roylston dryly. “I have
gathered enough of your meaning for the once. No&mdash;I
do not mean to punish you.” A bitter smile flickered
over his face. “As I sought to explain in my note,
which I had every intention should put a period to
the incident, our punishments in this school are not
adapted to the case. One has but two alternatives
in such affairs,&mdash;to expel or to ignore persons capable
of such conduct. I have concluded to ignore. I bid
you good evening.”</p>

<p>Tony opened his mouth to speak again, but closed
it quickly, and with a slight inclination of his head,
turned and left the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“He means to rub it in by slow degrees, by his
peculiar and unspeakable methods of torture,” was
Jimmie’s comment when Tony had told him of the
interview later. “You were an ass not to let me share
the responsibility. The Gumshoe accept an apology!
why, he hasn’t the charity of a mosquito. As Kit
would say,” he added thoughtfully, “he is ‘a gloomy
ass.’ Well, I reckon, Tonio, old sport, we’ll have
to chuck <i>The Spectacle</i>.”</p>

<p>“Hang it, of course, we will. It was a poor fool
sheet, Jim; rather a sad business for two good little
schoolboys like us to be taken up with.”</p>

<p>“And like most wicked things, amusing,” remarked
Reggie from the depths of an armchair where he had
been an interested hearer of the conversation. “Like
most forbidden things, diverting.”</p>

<p>“What a crude philosopher you sometimes are,
Reggie,” said Lawrence. “One looks to you for
illuminating comment&mdash;not for the obvious platitude.”</p>

<p>“True, my poet,” drawled Carroll, “but there are
moments when one inadvertently sinks below one’s
normal level. But adieu to some diverting moments!”</p>

<p>“Thanks! Adieu, too, to my Addisonian English!
I wish we could as easily bid adieu to the consequences.”</p>

<p>“I fancy it will be a long time before you say farewell
to those, my young friends.”</p>

<p>“Hm, he evidently doesn’t mean to take it to the
Head,” said Tony.</p>

<p>“No, not yet,” said Reggie, with the air of a prophet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
“the time is not ripe; but the Gumshoe, like Fate, will
take a fall out of you in the hour of your pride. Beware.”</p>

<p>“Bosh!” said Tony, “I’m going to forget it.” And
he fell to work.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="pch">TONY PLAYS THE PART OF A GUARDIAN ANGEL</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston put his policy with regard to Tony
into rigorous effect. From that day, except when it
was obviously necessary to speak with them about
their classroom work, he ignored Deering and his
friends. He treated them with an icy courtesy that
was far more effective in subduing their high spirits
than his sarcasm had ever been. Lawrence and
Wilson, particularly the latter, were restive under
the process, and often threatened, though they never
attempted, open rebellion. Tony, on the other hand,
was more sensitive to this peculiar method of revenge,
and it was probably due to his recognition of this
sensitiveness that Mr. Roylston had adopted it.
Deering knew that he had been guilty of ungentlemanly
conduct and he was not happy so long as his
whole-hearted apology was not accepted in the spirit
in which it was given. But there seemed no way in
which he could improve the situation. He tried to
prove his sincerity by doing specially good work in
Mr. Roylston’s class, but no word of commendation
ever fell from the master’s lips.</p>

<p>In truth Mr. Roylston had been wounded more
deeply than he had ever been before in a long career
that had been marked, too, by much open hostility.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
But unfortunately he was not the type that could
perceive that his difficulties largely lay in his own
fundamental lack of sympathy with boy nature; and,
resenting what he felt was the boys’ unjust attitude
toward him, he had not it in his soul then to forgive
such an offense as Tony had been guilty of. As he
looked back over their four or five years at Deal, the
incident of <i>The Spectacle</i> seemed to him but the culmination
of a long series of systematic attempts on
the part of that particular “crowd” to belittle and
annoy him. That the Head had practically required
him to give up the gating penalty, that he had perhaps
a lurking feeling that that penalty had been unjustly
imposed, added to the bitterness he felt for our young
friends.</p>

<p>And mixed up in all this affair of Deering and his
“crowd,” there was in Mr. Roylston’s mind a sense,
not clear but keen, that Finch was somehow concerned.
He genuinely believed that Doctor Forester had made
a mistake in taking Finch at Deal, and the passage
of words with Morris on the occasion of the boy’s
arrival, had irritated him intensely. He knew, and
was sometimes ashamed of the fact, that he had let
that irritation affect his treatment, in little ways, of
the boy himself. He had always disliked Morris,
and quite sincerely thought Morris’s unaffected good
nature and genial optimism with regard to boys was
a pose. The incident of Finch’s hazing, wherein he
had punished the rescuers instead of the hazers, increased
his uncomfortable feeling about the whole
situation. But the discomfort did not increase his
humility. He knew that in much he was wrong, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
he was so accustomed to the idea of supposing himself
to be right, that he argued away the accusations of
his conscience.</p>

<p>On Finch he therefore continued to vent a good deal
of his spleen. And on Finch the old sledge-hammer
method of sarcasm was an effective weapon. The
boy bore the master’s reproofs with a little less outward
wincing than of old, but inwardly they racked
his very soul. Mr. Roylston’s attitude affected him
very differently from the way it affected Deering. He
could not work in his class. A shaft of sarcasm, an
expression of patient suffering on the master’s face
as the boy blundered through his recitation, altogether
confused him. Day after day he would fail in a lesson
which he had spent hours in preparing. From a sense
of duty Mr. Roylston now and then would see the
delinquent outside of the classroom, and make an
attempt to clear up his difficulties. But on these
occasions Finch seemingly was more completely bereft
of his senses than during a recitation. Mr. Roylston
mistook this confusion for willful refusal to understand,
and in time treated him accordingly.</p>

<p>“What the deuce is the matter with you, Jake?”
Tony asked once, after a trying period in Latin,
wherein Finch had floundered about in absurd fashion.
“You know a heap more Latin than I do, but you go
in before Gumshoe and act as if he were asking you
questions in Sanscrit.”</p>

<p>“I know&mdash;I know,” Finch answered, miserably.
“But I can’t help it. I just can’t get my wits before
him. Every idea flies out of my head when he asks
me a question. I am doing all right in other subjects.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you go to Gumshoe and tell him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve tried,” said Finch. “That’s worse.”</p>

<p>“It’s a beastly shame,” said Tony. “But there’s
nothing I can do; I’m in with Gumshoe worse than
ever.”</p>

<p>“And that’s all my fault!”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” said Tony. “I had no business to
write that thing in the first place; neither had Jimmie
for that matter,&mdash;about Gumshoe or anybody else.
I wish I could convince him that I am really sorry.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you can’t do that,” said Finch.
“But if I had not been so stupid it wouldn’t have
happened. To tell you the truth, Deering, I often
wish I had never come here.”</p>

<p>“That’s idiotic!” said Tony; and then asked tactlessly,
“What would you have done?”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” Finch answered. “I guess it would
have been better if I had never been born.”</p>

<p>Poor Jake resented Mr. Roylston’s attitude toward
his hero much more than he did the master’s treatment
of himself. Once or twice, glancing up from his desk
in the schoolroom, Mr. Roylston caught a glance of
such concentrated hatred in Finch’s eyes, as actually
made him tremble. He attributed it, of course, to
the boy’s perverse and willful laziness, and once or
twice he returned Finch’s stare in a way, that though
the boy dropped his eyes beneath it, seemed to burn
into his soul.</p>

<p>Jacob failed miserably in Virgil at the mid-year
examinations in February, and did not do well enough
in his other work to counterbalance the bad impression
of his abject failure in Latin. The nervous, overwrought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
state in which he had been living during the
fall and winter told on his health. At the best he was
frail, but now he suffered frequently from intense headaches
that forced him much against his will, quite
frequently to spend two or three days in the Infirmary.</p>

<p>Tony saw all this more clearly than anyone else
except Morris. “What he needs,” he said one evening
to Jimmie and Kit, “is to get an interest in something,
to be brought out of himself, to get into something that
will bring him more in touch with the life of the school.”</p>

<p>Kit, in his easy-going way, agreed; and went on
strumming his guitar, on which he had been trying to
pick out a new popular air. Jimmie gave the matter
a little thought and asked, “What can he do?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tony, after a moment or so, “I’ve
been thinking that it would be a good thing to put him
up for the Dealonian.”</p>

<p>“The Dealonian!” exclaimed Kit, tossing the guitar
aside. “Why, man, you’re plumb nutty. He’s got as
much chance of getting into the Dealonian as I have
of getting into Congress. A fine figure that little
scarecrow would cut in a public meeting, wouldn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think he could do it,” protested Tony, a
little sharply, for he was annoyed by Kit’s tone. “It
would give him a lot of confidence if we took him in.
It would make him feel that the best fellows in school
were willing to give him a chance.”</p>

<p>“I dare say it would make him feel that,” Lawrence
remarked judiciously. “But I can’t say that I see
that he has any particular claim to consideration.
The Dealonian isn’t exactly an asylum for the maimed,
the halt and the blind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, of course, it isn’t, but it’s supposed to be run
for the benefit of the school, isn’t it? And ‘the good
of the school’ simply means the good of the fellows
in school. Finch has as much right to the Dealonian,
if there’s a chance of it being a help to him, as you or
I have.”</p>

<p>“But he hasn’t any chance, d’ye see?” said Kit.</p>

<p>“No I don’t see,” answered Tony. “I dare say
the three of us have a certain amount of influence,
and if we chose to exert it I’ve an idea that we could
get him in.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can hang that harp on a weeping willow-tree,”
was Kit’s conclusive comment, “I don’t intend
to try. I am perfectly willing to lick Ducky Thornton
every day in the week for hazing him, if need be;
I’m willing to have Tony bring him in here three
or four times a week and bore us to death, if he wants
to; but I’m hanged if I’ll try to get him into the
Dealonian. That’s supposed to be made up of the
representative fellows of the school. You’re carrying
your guardian angelship business too far, kiddo. Put
that in your pipe and smoke it.”</p>

<p>Tony, for once, did not reply in like fashion to Kit’s
vigorous and breezy way of expressing himself. He
reflected a moment or so, and then spoke with an
unusually quiet and determined air, as though he were
simply making an announcement and not asking
advice. “I have thought it over pretty carefully,
Kit; and I’ve made up my mind to try it. I only hope
you fellows will back me up.”</p>

<p>Jimmie was silent. Kit, convinced at last that Tony
was indeed in earnest, protested vigorously. “You’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
dead wrong, Tony. You oughtn’t to try it. The
fellows won’t stand for it. And you’ve no right to
ask me to back you up in a thing which I’m perfectly
certain is a darn fool proposition.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tony, “you needn’t back me up,
if you don’t want to. But that’s all rot for you to
say it’s a darn fool notion. I’ve a perfect right to
put him up, if I think it the thing to do, and I am
going to do it.”</p>

<p>“Well, go ahead, and waste your time. I s’pose the
little pup’ll lick your boots cleaner than ever in gratitude,
whether you’re successful or not.”</p>

<p>Tony flared up at this. “I’ll thank you, Wilson, not
to call my friends pups. I reckon I can find some
decent chaps to vote for him, even if I can’t count on
my own pals.” And with that, very hot in the head,
he flung himself out of the room.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be darned,” said Kit. “To think of him
flinging me over for that drowned rat! What’s the
matter with him? Has he gone clean crazy?”</p>

<p>“He’s got the kid on his brain. But no sense in your
flaring out so, Kit; that’s no way to get on with Tony.
Naturally he’s sensitive.”</p>

<p>“Who flared up?” demanded Kit, indignantly.
“I’m as calm as a millpond. Tony went off the handle
because we disagreed with him. I guess I’ve as good
a right to my opinions as he has to his.”</p>

<p>“Oh, for gosh’s sake, shut up; there’s no sense in
quarreling over this matter. Finch won’t get into the
Dealonian, but whether he can or not, I’d just as soon
vote for him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be hanged if I would,” asserted Wilson.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
“And what’s more I’ll get up in the meeting and say
it’s a darn fool proposition and ought to be turned
down.”</p>

<p>“What’s the sense in doing that? It’ll just mean
that you and Tony will have a serious falling-out,
and the crowd will get busted up. What’s the use?
It ain’t worth while.”</p>

<p>“The heck it isn’t! I won’t compromise a principle
for a friend ever, I don’t care who he is. Nor I won’t
have a friend ram his ideas down my throat. I’ve
as much right to put a fellow up or blackball him in
the Dealonian as Tony has. Seems to me he’s getting&mdash;&mdash;.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up. You are working yourself all up
over nothing. It isn’t worth it. Don’t quarrel with
Tony.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me Tony’s picking the quarrel with me.
Who flung himself out of the room just now? I didn’t,
I guess. I tell you what, Jim, if Tony wants to keep
on good terms with me, he can; but he’s not going to
make the price of his friendship my voting to suit him
about anything. I guess we made Tony Deering in this
school&mdash;you and I.”</p>

<p>“Rot!” exclaimed Jimmie. “Tony made himself.
He’d have been the head of the school if we had never
exchanged a word with him. We’ve been darn glad
to have him in the crowd, that’s the truth of it; he’s
been the center of it ever since he’s been here. You
were keen enough about making him president of the
Dealonian, and I guess you want him for head prefect
next year.”</p>

<p>“’Course I was keen; ‘course I do ... I’m all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
serene. If there’s a quarrel, it won’t be my fault.
But I’m going to blackball Finch for the good of the
Society, ‘cause I think it would be a mistake to let
him in, and I hope you’ll do the same.”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t.”</p>

<p>“Do as you please, that’s <i>your</i> right. So long,
kiddo, I guess I’ll seek a more congenial clime for the
time bein’.” And with that Kit swung himself out of
the room.</p>

<p>Jimmie, genuinely distressed by this first serious
difference in their congenial little circle, went over to
Mr. Morris’s room, and took him into his confidence
on the subject. Morris was not a little disturbed
by the situation. He admired Tony’s purpose, but
with Jimmie, thought it somewhat ill-judged and ill-timed,
and deplored the possible cleavage it might
make in the little knot of friends. But, characteristically,
he did not see his way to interfering, even
with advice.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Tony and Kit again encountered each
other that night in Reggie Carroll’s room. Tony was
cool, and Reggie, ignorant of what had happened, made
matters worse by asking them facetiously what had
ruffled the sweet waters of their friendship.</p>

<p>“Ask Tony,” answered Kit laconically, as he
thumbed a school year book and tried to think of
some way of getting out of the room.</p>

<p>Tony shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” repeated Reggie.</p>

<p>“Nothing particular,” Deering answered, after a
pause. “We just don’t pull together in a certain
matter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, what do you expect,” exclaimed Kit impulsively,
“do you expect me to measure my opinions
by yours?”</p>

<p>“Rather not,” answered Tony, with a faint sneer,
“you’d find them in that case a darn sight too big for
you.”</p>

<p>“Softly, softly,” protested Reggie. But Tony
again was gone.</p>

<p>When he got back to his own room later in the
evening, Jimmie tried to talk the subject over with him,
but Tony, ruffled and irritated, was not inclined to do
so.</p>

<p>“I’ve made up my mind, Jim, so that’s all there is
to it. I’m going to put Finch up next Saturday night,
and in the meantime I’m going to work hard to try
to get the fellows to vote for him. I hope you won’t
blackball him.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t do that, Tony; but I wish you’d see
Kit and talk it over with him in a friendly way.”</p>

<p>“I’ll talk it over with Kit, if he wants to talk it over
with me; but he has got to drop his swagger and bulldozing
manner, if he wants to.”</p>

<p>“Look here, old man; Kit’s just impulsive; that’s all.
Suppose I, after I had thought it over, made up my
mind that it would be a bad thing for the Society
and blackballed Finch, would you let that make any
difference between us?”</p>

<p>Tony thought a moment. “No, old chap, of course
it wouldn’t. I’d be sorry, of course, because I would
feel you were wrong. But it isn’t being opposed that
makes me sore, it’s Kit’s blustering blowing way of
doing it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Jimmie went that night and sat on Tony’s bed for
a long time after lights. They said nothing more about
Kit or Finch, but talked intimately of a variety of
other things in which they were interested, in the
old close pleasant way. It was a long happy quiet
talk and it did much to strengthen their friendship in
the times of stress that were coming.</p>

<p>The conversations we have recorded took place well
along in the winter term on a Monday night in March.
The following Saturday evening was the date of the
important meeting of the Dealonian Society at which
new members were elected.</p>

<p>Tony spent a zealous week campaigning for Finch,
and found it a disheartening business. Most of the
boys&mdash;there were about forty members of the Society&mdash;protested,
but after long persuasion, promised to
cast favorable votes, though they took pains, almost
without exception, to assure Tony that they were
doing it simply because he asked them. Others
refused definitely to commit themselves, and Tony
had to be content with that. To Jimmie’s distress,
Kit kept away from Number Five study all that
week, and refused to make any advances toward setting
things right with Tony. “I’ll talk it over,
if he comes to me,” he would say to Jimmie over and
over. “But I am going to blackball Finch, and I
guess I can persuade at least one other fellow to do the
same, so he won’t get into the Dealonian. Tony can
do what he pleases. After it’s all over, if he wants
to make up, well and good; I’ll have no hard feelings:
if he don’t,&mdash;well, well and good, also.”</p>

<p>At last, after what seemed an interminable week to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
our three friends Saturday night came, and the forty
members of the Dealonian Society met in solemn conclave
in the Library. Tony took the chair, looking a
trifle nervous and anxious, and called the meeting to
order. Kit was present, sitting well back, and assumed
an air of bland indifference to the proceedings. There
were four new members to be elected from the Fifth
Form.</p>

<p>Routine business was transacted for a quarter of
an hour, and at last the president announced, “If
there is no objection, we will proceed to the election
of new members. As I wish to place a name in nomination,
I will ask Mr. Wendell to take the chair.”</p>

<p>Billy Wendell, the head prefect, captain of the
football team, and the last year’s president of the
Dealonian, rose from his seat, and took the chair
behind the big desk in a very solemn way, very much
as a president <i>pro tem</i>. walks up to the platform of the
Senate. He settled himself, coughed slightly, and
recognized Tony. “Mr. Deering has the floor,” he
observed in judicial tones.</p>

<p>“Mr. President and members of the Dealonian
Society, I desire to place in nomination for membership
in this society the name of Jacob Finch of the Fifth
Form.” As this was expected, the boys showed little
surprise. Jimmie glanced back at Kit, and saw his
lips curl with faint contempt. Tony too glanced
about him; then, after a moment’s hesitation, he threw
back his shoulders, and addressed the Society. He
cast aside now the solemn traditional oratorical form
that the boys made an effort to assume, and his clear
sweet voice rang with feeling. “Fellows,” he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
“I believe, as we all do, that this Society has the right
to consider itself the most important institution in
the school, and I realize that I am nominating one
for membership in it, who, according to all standards
we have set for ourselves and which have been so
well maintained through many school generations,
seems not to have a shadow of right to election. We
want here fellows whose opinion counts, whose influence
will be strong and positive, who have done
and are able to do things for the school, in athletics, in
scholarship, and in various other ways. I can’t
pretend that I think that Jacob Finch will stand for
these things or will do these things. But for once,
it seems to me, that other considerations should weigh
with us.”</p>

<p>The boys were startled by the unusual feeling in
Deering’s voice and by the unconventional arguments
he was using to urge his candidate upon their favor,
and they settled into attitudes of deep attention.</p>

<p>“At the beginning of the year,” Tony went on,
“a new boy came amongst us who, as we all know,
has been treated as no boy ever was who came to the
school before. He has been brutally hazed, and
for months his life has been made miserable by young
and old, and unfortunately he has had no way of
defending himself. He has never had a chance, he
hasn’t got a square deal. I have got to know him, I
suppose, better than anyone else, and while I don’t
claim or even think that he is an unusual fellow, I
do believe there is something in him that could be
made to count for the school if he had a show; if it
could really be proved to him that you fellows were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
willing to make him one of yourselves, give him not
merely a fair, but a generous chance. I don’t want you
merely to admit him to this Society because I ask it
as a favor to me, though I hope you will do it for that
reason if you won’t do it for any other; but I ask you
to vote for him as an act of generous kindness toward
a chap who hasn’t had the chance that any of us have
had, whose life in this school up to now has been
downright hell.”</p>

<p>With that Tony sat down. A ripple of conversation
went round the room. The boys were quite won
by this unusual appeal to their generosity and sympathy.
Billy Wendell called them sharply to order.
“Are there any further remarks upon Finch?”</p>

<p>Half a dozen fellows rose one after another, and
declared, with a certain amount of feeling and a
certain lack of grace, that they agreed with Deering,
and that they thought Finch ought to be elected.
Jimmie wanted to speak for Tony’s sake, but he could
not quite bring himself to do so. In his heart he agreed
with Kit that Tony’s judgment on this occasion was
mistaken, and that were Finch elected it would not
accomplish for him what Tony so generously hoped.
There was a pause after good-natured Clayton had
uttered a few stuttering sentimental remarks. Then
Kit Wilson rose up quickly. His face was flushed, he
seemed nervous, but there were lines of dogged determination
about his mouth.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman,” he said, “we have all been moved
by the eloquence of our popular president. I want
to say, however, that I feel very strongly that the considerations
that should guide us in this affair are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
those of sentiment or of personal friendship. I think,
Mr. Chairman, that the president of this Society has
no right to ask us to vote for a fellow on his nomination
as a personal favor to himself. The argument that
it is up to us to give Finch a better show in the
school than he’s had, by electing him to this Society is
no doubt generous, but it is sentimental. I agree with
Mr. Deering that we should do everything in our power
to make Finch’s life a pleasanter and a happier one
than it probably has been. I do not think, however,
that to do this it is necessary to elect him to the
Dealonian Society, the membership of which is
supposed to be made up of those who really represent
the various activities of the school. I sincerely trust
he will not be elected.”</p>

<p>With that he sat down, and some one immediately
called for a vote. The Dealonian voted on membership
by roll call, the secretary reading the names and the
boys responding <i>Placet</i> or <i>Non Placet</i>, as the case
might be. To Tony’s surprise boy after boy voted in
the affirmative. Tack Turner, one of “the crowd,”
was the first to blackball, but after him the voting
again was favorable. Wilson’s name was the last
called. “Non Placet,” he said quietly, without
looking up.</p>

<p>“The name is rejected,” said Wendell, and resigned
the chair.</p>

<p>The meeting went on, several other names were
proposed and accepted. After the adjournment, Tony,
bitterly disappointed not in the result, which he had
feared, but by the means it had been obtained, avoided
speaking with his friends, and hurried out. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
corridor he came face to face with Kit. Their eyes
met, and Tony’s lip curled contemptuously. “Well,”
he exclaimed sarcastically, “you were successful,
weren’t you!”</p>

<p>Kit stared back with a dark scowl on his good-looking,
usually kindly face. “I did as I thought
right,” he answered.</p>

<p>Tony smiled with a look of insulting incredulity.
“Let me congratulate you on your sense of duty.”
Then he hurried on to his own room, and fell to work
with self-deceptive industry at his books.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="pch">A RIFT IN FRIENDSHIP</p>

<p>The prominent members of a particular set of boys
can scarcely be on bad terms with each other without
the relations of them all being more or less affected,
and this was certainly the case with our friends at
Deal. Tony had more and more become the real
leader of the little circle, so that Kit’s defection partook
of the nature of a rebellion.</p>

<p>Tack Turner, who had blackballed Finch at Kit’s
request, had by that act lined himself on Wilson’s
side. He was a slow, rather dull boy, quieter than the
others, but generally liked. He had not felt particularly
one way or the other with regard to Finch, and
had agreed with Kit chiefly because it happened to
be Kit that spoke to him first. But having given
his word, he was of that tenacious and somewhat
unintelligent type, that will stick to it whether subsequent
events show his position to be a reasonable one
or not. His semi-indifferent attitude was transformed,
however, into violent partisanship for Kit, as Tony
took occasion the morning after the Dealonian meeting
to express his opinion of Tack’s blackballing Finch
somewhat caustically.</p>

<p>“I confess, Tack,” he said “that I never gave you
the credit for much independence of judgment, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
didn’t think you were quite so devoid of it as to vote
just the way you were told to.”</p>

<p>Turner growled out a bitter retort to this unnecessary
remark, and the two parted on bad terms for
the first time in their lives.</p>

<p>Charlie Gordon, a light-hearted, easy-going,
generous-minded lad sided naturally enough with
Tony, and had been quite impressed by Tony’s eloquence
the evening before. Teddy Lansing had not
voted, and refused to commit himself. Poor Jimmie
Lawrence was torn in both directions. He had been
willing enough to vote for Finch and let Tony have his
way, because he was deeply and genuinely fond of him,
and was accustomed to follow his lead; but he could
not bring himself to feel, despite Tony’s eloquent
appeal at the meeting, that there was any real case
for Finch with respect to the Dealonian, and he
deplored the fact that Tony insisted on his plan. He
was fond of Kit also; they had been chums since they
had entered Deal together in the First Form five
years before. His position was really a very hard one,
because he felt and tried to be neutral, and neither
Tony nor Kit, between whom the breach grew wider,
was satisfied with neutrality. Both actually, if not
expressly, were demanding partisanship.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most unfortunate aspect of the incident&mdash;and
this also Jimmie had dimly foreseen and feared&mdash;was
the effect it had on Jacob Finch. Forty boys cannot
keep a secret, so that it was not long before Finch
heard a tolerably correct version of what had taken
place at the Dealonian meeting. He was grateful
to Deering for the effort he had made in his behalf,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
but the consciousness that he had been publicly
discussed by a society of representative boys and
formally rejected as a candidate for their companionship,
added intensely to the bitterness of what he
felt was his position.</p>

<p>Sometimes when he was alone and thought of the
incident, the hot tears would well up in his eyes
and blind him. Bitter thoughts likewise would rise
up in his soul and overwhelm him. He sometimes
felt he could not stick it out for the year. But then,
what else could he do? He could not think. He was
absolutely dependent upon Doctor Forester, and he
was not of the caliber to act rashly, go bravely out
and face the hostile world. And the world seemed
hostile to him&mdash;the very elements, these biting winter
winds and prolonged northeast storms&mdash;seemed to
beat against him. Hated alike by masters and boys,
as he thought, he indeed was miserable. And, alas!
save for his ardent affection for Deering, he began to
hate bitterly and maliciously in return.</p>

<p>Life had taught him to be sly and silent, but heretofore
beyond a furtive manner and an intense reserve,
the quality of slyness had not shown itself.
But now his malice seemed to demand expression,
impelled him to action, and he began, first in little
ways, afterwards by more systematic plans to torment
his tormentors. But so secretly, so cautiously, that,
though his sting was felt, his victim was ignorant
whence it had come.</p>

<p>The principal objects of his hatred were Mr. Roylston
and Kit Wilson, the latter only after he learned of
Kit’s breach with Tony. Mr. Roylston began to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
afflicted with a series of annoying and inexplicable
incidents; anonymous letters were slipped into his
mail-box, threatening him with dire calamities unless
he speedily exhibited a change of heart; his books,
his papers were misplaced, to be found in out-of-the-way
places; twice or thrice his study was disordered;
and once, at night as he was crossing the field, mud was
thrown at him and his immaculate clothes were sadly
bespattered. But so carefully did the culprit destroy
all clues to his identity that the master had no redress.
For once he was baffled. Never, so contemptuous an
opinion did he hold of Finch’s spirit, did it occur to him
even to suspect the poor worm whom daily he ground
beneath the brazen feet of his sarcasm in the classroom.</p>

<p>He took little Beverly into his confidence as they
sat late one night over a comfortable fire in the masters’
common-room.</p>

<p>“These things,” he remarked, “have been going on
now for a number of weeks, and for the first time in
my experience I do not discover the slightest clue to
the culprit.”</p>

<p>“Of course, however,” was Beverly’s comment,
made partly to display his omniscience, partly to
flatter an older colleague, “of course, you have your
suspicions?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” responded Roylston dryly, “that goes
without saying. I have suspected both Deering and
Wilson, whom indeed several times before have I
discovered in misdemeanors of a similar character;
but, if you chance to have been observing of late, you
will have noticed and wondered that those two charming
youths no longer consort together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, boys of that sort,” said Beverly blithely, to
hide his ignorance of the alleged coolness, “boys of
that sort always fall out after a time. Mischief is a
poor cement for friendship.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary it has been my observation that
it often does cement it. But I am the less inclined
to lay my annoyances to the two boys I have mentioned
than I would be if they were as thick as they
formerly were. Wilson simply has not the ingenuity
or the wit to do such things for so long a time and
escape detection; and Deering lacks the incentive
of Wilson’s impulsive and malignant vindictiveness.
I am inclined to feel that I will discover the miscreant
in some other set. Alas! they are not the only boys
not above such things.”</p>

<p>“I would keep an eye on my suspects, however,”
remarked Beverly, with an air of conviction that he
was offering very subtle advice.</p>

<p>“Oh, my eye is ever on suspects, my friend.”</p>

<p>At that moment Morris happened to come into the
common-room, and the conversation was dropped.</p>

<p>Finch, impishly elated by the successful secrecy
of his attentions to Mr. Roylston and finding a certain
relief for his spleen in his malicious tricks, began to
extend his operations, concentrating on Wilson. Kit,
when he discovered the tricks that had been played
upon him, would storm about noisily, berating possible
miscreants right and left, but for some time
with as little effect as had attended Mr. Roylston’s
quieter efforts. Success, however, rarely waits upon
the criminal faithfully. He grows inevitably careless
and falls at last into the most obvious trap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
that is set for him. Poor Jake proved no exception.</p>

<p>Twice in a week Kit had come in about four o’clock
from his run across country with the hare and hounds,
an unpopular game that he was seeking to boom, to
find his room “rough-housed.” It was not the general
disorder familiarly known by that term, but a more
systematic confusion, if we may so speak; a more
malicious effort to injure his property. His prepared
work for the next day’s recitations would be smeared
with ink so that it would have to be completely rewritten;
his desk drawers would be turned topsy-turvy;
his clothes hidden away in unexpected nooks
and corners. This had happened several times, and
the character of the destruction was more wanton
than is often the case when boys indulge in such misguided
forms of practical joking. He determined to
watch carefully for weeks, if necessary, and catch
the culprit if he should attempt to repeat his vandalism.</p>

<p>As usual, one afternoon after two o’clock call-over,
he went off ostensibly for his run in running drawers
and shirt, his white legs and arms gleaming in the
winter sunshine, as he dashed down the hill with his
hounds. But this time he deserted them at the
foot of the hill, skirted the path along the Rocks in
the direction of Whetstone and returned to the school
within half-an-hour by way of the steep-sloping south
field, which faces Monday Port and which the boys
seldom played upon. Unobserved, for his schoolmates
were mostly far afield, he reached Standerland, tiptoed
through the corridors to his room, and once inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
hid himself carefully behind the curtains that screened
the door into his bedroom.</p>

<p>He waited impatiently a long dull half-hour, and
several times was on the point of giving up; but for
all his impulsiveness, Kit was doggedly persistent,
and was quite capable of waiting there for an hour
or more several times a week. And at last, to his joy,
he heard a soft step in the corridor. Some one had
paused before his door, and was evidently listening
for sounds within. Then there was a gentle tap.
Kit was still as a mouse. Another tap, another wait,
then the door opened softly, and some one slipped in.
Kit scarcely breathed. He could not see who it was,
but he heard the intruder close the door gently behind
him and stand for a moment, as Kit thought, looking
furtively around him. He even came to the door of
the bedroom, brushing the curtains back of which Kit
was concealed as he passed. Then, satisfied at last that
he was safe and alone, he went quickly to Kit’s desk,
opened the drawers and thrust malicious disturbing
hands amongst their contents. Then he drew forth
a bundle of papers. Kit heard him rattle the ink-well,
and his quick ears caught the sound of the patter of
the ink drops as they fell on the papers. Instantly he
leaped forward, with one bound was across the room,
and had grabbed the vandal by the collar. It was
Jacob Finch.</p>

<p>For a moment, as Kit recognized the intruder, he
was speechless with surprise. Finch stood as if he were
paralyzed, in the position in which Kit had grabbed
him. Only the ink-well had fallen from his fingers,
and the black fluid was trickling from the desk onto
the floor. His face was ashy, his eyes glared like those
of a rat in a corner. In a second Kit recovered
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“You little hound,” he hissed, his anger blazing
forth. “So it’s you that’s been rough-housing my
room!”</p>

<p>Finch could not utter a word.</p>

<p>“Speak up, you cur. Bah! there’s no need. I’ve
got you in the act. You’re caught red-handed, you
sneak!”</p>

<p>He advanced threateningly, determined to administer
instantly the sound thrashing he felt was too
good for the palsied little wretch before him. As he
grasped Finch’s collar the second time, the boy let
out a weird shrill wail like the cry of an animal.</p>

<p>“Pah!” cried Wilson, “I can’t stand the touch of
you. Get out of my sight.” He gave Finch a vicious
kick that sent him reeling toward the door.</p>

<p>“If ever you come near my room again,” shouted
Kit, “I’ll break every bone in your miserable body.
You sneak! You cur! Get out!”</p>

<p>Poor Finch did not debate upon the manner of his
going. With one movement, he had wrenched open
the door and fled, not escaping, however, a parting
shot from Wilson’s boot.</p>

<p>Kit turned wrathfully to survey his damaged desk
and papers, and began to clear the litter up.</p>

<p>“The sneak!” he muttered. “And that’s the
specimen that Tony Deering thought we ought to
take into the Dealonian, that’s the dirty little cur for
whom he’s thrown me over!”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as Finch sped down the corridor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
for his own room, he ran squarely into Tony who was
just coming out of Number Five study.</p>

<p>“Well, what the deuce is the matter with you?”
exclaimed Deering, turning to look at the bewildered
figure. But Finch did not reply. He dashed into his
own room, and slammed and locked the door. Tony
whistled softly, and went on. He was on his way to
the shower, and had nothing on but his wrapper.
His way led past Number Twelve study where Kit
roomed, and at its door, as he turned a corner of the
corridor, he saw Wilson thrusting armfuls of paper
into the waste basket. Tony dropped his eyes and
did not speak. Wilson looked up suddenly and recognized
him, and impulsively exclaimed: “I say, Deering,
just look here and see what a mess your particular pet
has made for me.”</p>

<p>Tony stopped, surprised, and annoyed by Wilson’s
angry tone. He glanced indifferently at the disordered
room, the desk stained by the great blot of ink, the
crumbled papers. “Well,” he remarked, “I don’t
see how this concerns me or my friends.”</p>

<p>“You don’t, eh?” exclaimed Kit. “Well, I blamed
well do. That’s the sort of thing I’ve had to put
up with for the last three weeks. Your friend Finch
has been in here, kindly putting my room on the
bum.”</p>

<p>“Finch!” cried Tony. “I don’t be&mdash;I reckon you’ve
made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“I <i>reckon</i> I haven’t. I laid for him, if you want to
know; and I had the pleasure just now of kicking him
out. If I catch him in here again, I’ll break every bone
in his body. Since you are so deeply interested in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
welfare, you’ll be doing him a kindness if you tell him
that for me.”</p>

<p>Deering’s lips curled contemptuously. “I don’t
know exactly what you are driving at, Wilson, and
I don’t think I particularly care.”</p>

<p>Kit snorted, and went on with the task of setting
his things to right. Tony majestically proceeded
toward the shower. After he had stood for a quarter
of an hour under cold water he felt considerably cooler,
and when he had dressed, he stopped at Finch’s room
on his way to the Rectory for tea. Finch at first
refused to respond to his knock.</p>

<p>“Come, come, open up, old man. I want to see you
particularly.”</p>

<p>It was a bedraggled depressed-looking Finch that
finally opened his door. Deering pushed it back and
entered. “Now, what’s the trouble?” he asked. “I
know something’s up, because Wilson just now said
he had&mdash;had put you out of his room. What were you
there for?”</p>

<p>“He did put me out,” gasped Finch. He hesitated,
then lied desperately. “I wanted to borrow some paper.
I thought of asking you, but Wilson had the kind I
wanted. He wasn’t in, or at least I thought he wasn’t
in, so I went to his desk, and began to pull some
sheets off his pad, and he jumped on me from behind
a curtain or out of his bedroom, from somewhere,
I dunno where.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much. He called me a sneak, and kicked
me out.”</p>

<p>“How did the ink get spilled?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“I knocked it over when he jumped at me. Somebody’s
been rough-housing his room, I guess, and he
thought it was me.”</p>

<p>“Well, it wasn’t you, Jake, was it?” asked Tony,
fixing him with a keen hurt glance.</p>

<p>“No, Deering, ‘pon my honor, it wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“Had you ever been to his room before?”</p>

<p>“Never alone.” His eyes shifted back to meet
Tony’s wondering glance. “Don’t you believe me,
Deering?” There was a wail of despair in his voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, Jake, yes; of course, I believe you. I know
you wouldn’t lie to me. Cheer up, I’ll try to get
Wilson to listen to reason.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t&mdash;!” Jake stopped, aghast at his possible
mistake. “I don’t want you to do anything for me,
Deering, you’ve done enough. I’m just always getting
you in trouble.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Jake; helping a friend out isn’t
trouble.”</p>

<p>And with that Tony went on. He stopped again at
Wilson’s room. The door was still open, and Kit was
still fussing about his desk. He looked up at the knock,
and scowled a little as he bade his visitor come in.</p>

<p>Tony came in and closed the door behind him.
“Look here, Kit,” he said, trying hard to keep control
of his voice. “I want to speak to you about Finch.
I think you have done him a wrong. He came in here
to borrow some paper&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that the song and dance he gives you? Well,
I know what he came in for. If you want to know,
I kept still behind those curtains for a couple of
minutes while he started his dirty work, and I caught<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
him right in the act, with that ink-well in his greasy
fingers smearing my exercises with it. He has been
rough-housing this room for two or three weeks.”</p>

<p>“Well, he says he hasn’t, and I don’t think he’s
a liar. Will you give him a chance to explain?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be hanged if I will. I know he’s a liar. I
know it, man. Don’t talk to me any such blamed
rot about his coming in here to borrow paper; he’s
a sneak and a toad, and if he comes near me again
I’ll lick the life out of him.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, bully a chap that can’t defend himself.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Tony. I hate to quarrel with you,
but it’s got to come. I thought you were wrong
about that kid from the first; he ain’t fit for help,
and ’s for the Dealonian,&mdash;well, save the mark! But
it’s come to this&mdash;you and I can’t be friends, if you are
going to take that little sneak’s part against me.
We’ll just break for good and all. You can’t be a
friend of mine, and take the attitude toward him
that you’ve been taking. I might have got over the
other business; but I can’t get over to-day’s dirty work,
and for you to come in here, and tell me the pack of
lies he’s made up, is too much. Let’s cut it out, and
have done with each other.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right; if that’s your point of view, I’m
willing. You’re unreasonable and hot-headed, Kit.
So long, old man, I’m sorry you can’t be just.”</p>

<p>“So long,” said Wilson, as Tony stalked out.</p>

<p>For a moment or so Kit fumed about, pulling things
out of their places and thrusting them viciously back.
Suddenly he put his head down on the table, and
burst into tears.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="pch">LEAVE-TAKING</p>

<p>The short Easter vacation, during which Tony had
visited Jimmie, had come and gone, and our friends
were settled down again into the routine of the spring
term. For the time being, much to the discomfort
of all concerned, the old crowd was broken up. Tony
and Kit did not even speak to each other, so that
Jimmie had a hard time keeping on friendly terms
with them both.</p>

<p>The winter had long since broken completely. Long
lazy days were come again when the sea glistened
like glass under shining skies and the mounting sun
was rapidly warming the earth into green good humor.
The fields were dotted in the afternoons with a dozen
developing baseball teams composed of white clad,
red-capped boys. Boats, too, heavily manned by
members of the rival school clubs, sped out of the
little harbor tucked under Strathsey Neck, and, plied
by their happy crews, went scudding on half-holidays
up the River or boldly out past Deigr Light into
the open ocean. It was a happy term at Deal: boys
and masters expanded in the genial sunshine, and
for the most part the stress of the long winter
term problems and discipline was wholly relaxed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Lawrence and Deering threw themselves into baseball,
worked fairly faithfully at their books, and thus kept
themselves happy and contented. Kit Wilson was
coaching one of the younger teams on the north field,
so that they did not come in contact with him very
frequently. Jimmie would go to his rooms often in
the evening, but he came no more to Number Five
study.</p>

<p>Kit had said nothing about his affair with Finch;
but, as he expected, his rooms were disturbed no more.
Finch, terrified by discovery and the fear of exposure,
for a long time abandoned his vandalism entirely.
His conscience was troubled by the fact that he had
lied to Tony, but less perhaps than he would have been
disturbed if Tony knew the truth. There was on
both his and Tony’s part a certain sense of strain
in their friendly relations, which Tony, however,
tried to ignore. He believed of course that Finch had
told him the truth about the episode in Wilson’s
room and that Wilson had simply been mistaken;
but after Kit’s open break with him, he saw no way
to set things right.</p>

<p>This troubled him a great deal and cast a gloom over
much of that bright spring term that otherwise might
have been so happy. Each boy felt the loss of the
other’s friendship keenly, but both were impulsive,
both felt themselves right, both had been stung to
the quick by the other’s attitude. Time, as often
happens, widened the breach.</p>

<p>One day in Fifth English they were reading <i>As You
Like It</i>, and it fell to Kit to read the lines of Amiens’
song in the second act:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p class="ppq4 p1">“Heigh-ho! sing heigh-ho! unto the green holly:<br />
Most friendship is feigning, most love merely folly.</p>

<p class="pphq8 p1">“Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,</p>
<p class="pph8">Thou dost not bite so nigh<br />
As benefits forgot:</p>
<p class="pph8">Though thou the waters warp,</p>
<p class="pph8">Thy sting is not so sharp<br />
As friend remembered not.”</p>

<p class="p1">As he got toward the end of the lines, his voice
almost broke. Stenton, realizing with quick sympathy
that the song had taken on for him some keen personal
meaning, passed on the reading immediately to another
boy. Tony sat in his seat flushed and uncomfortable;
for him also the verse had intense meaning.
He longed to look up and catch Kit’s eye, and then
join him after class and say boldly how foolish he
felt their coolness was. But he did not do so. He
felt he never could do so. Kit had been too unfair,
too bitter&mdash;the advance must come from him.</p>

<p>Suddenly one day, in the midst of all this intense
life and activity of school so absorbing to our boys,
there came a word to Tony that was rudely and without
warning to take him out of it. The message came
in the form of a letter from his grandfather bidding
him come home at once.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“It will be bad news to you, my dear boy,” he wrote, “but your
unfortunate father’s business venture has been an absolute failure;
he has been very ill and is only just now on the road to recovery,
and your poor mother has fallen a victim at last to the
worry and strain. She wants you, and the doctor and I think it
best for you to come. So you must do so at once, as I am writing
to the Head Master. I don’t know, Anthony, whether we shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
able or not to send you back next year. We poor people of the
south, when Fortune turns against us, are pretty well down and
out. You have made a good record at school, and I do not doubt
but that Doctor Forester will promote you to the Sixth Form next
year, should we be able to send you back, even if you do lose these
two months. But you must come now, and at once. Telegraph
me the day and hour and I will have Sambo meet you at the
Junction.</p>

<p class="pr6">“Your affectionate grandfather,</p>

<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">Basil Deering</span>.”</p>

<p class="p1">Poor Tony read this letter over and over before he
could clearly take it in. He knew something of old
of his reckless father’s terrible propensity to indulge
in wild-cat speculation, of the disaster and trouble it
had brought upon the family at Low Deering before.
And now too his mother was ill! Of course, of course,
he must go home. He fumbled in his drawer and
found a time-table. Yes, he could leave that night.
And yet&mdash;he paused, with the letter in his hand&mdash;it
was like a sentence of banishment: to leave school
now in the middle of the best term of the year, and
with so many things in which he was interested at
loose ends! He could not believe it really meant
that; it could not be true. And perhaps never to
return! He looked again at his letter, and the old
general’s words made him sick at heart. Never again
to race up and down that hillside, to look out upon that
splendid sea; never again to swagger about the campus
with his chums in the old glad, happy, self-important
way! No, no, he could not bear that it should mean
that! The hot tears welled in his eyes,&mdash;but he
brushed them away. Of course, his mother needed
him. He had gone through before those agonizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
family crises, had seen his tender patient mother
struggle bravely against his father’s bad moods and
dark despair. He knew that indeed she must have
collapsed when his grandfather sent for him and she
permitted it.</p>

<p>He ran over to the Rectory and found the Doctor
in his study. He too had just been reading a letter
from General Deering.</p>

<p>He clasped Tony’s hand in his strong affectionate
grip. “I am sorry for you, my boy.... Yes, I
have just been reading a letter from your grandfather.
There is no choice but for you to go at once.”</p>

<p>“I can leave on the ten o’clock from Monday Port,
to-night, sir,” said Tony, “and catch the midnight
express at Coventry, which will get me home the
next evening.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless that is the best plan,” the Doctor
agreed. “I don’t think, from what the General tells
me, that you need worry about your mother’s
immediate condition. But undoubtedly you are
needed. I am very sorry that you should lose these
two months, but you can keep up your work at home
and there is no reason why you should not make the
Sixth comfortably in September.”</p>

<p>“I think I could do that, sir,” replied Tony, “but
my grandfather says there is some doubt about&mdash;about
their being able to send me back next year.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, he writes that to me; but you are to
come, nevertheless. We will arrange that. I hope
the financial difficulties will straighten out satisfactorily,
but if worst comes to worst and they should
not, why there are any number of ways that we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
provide for you. There is always a scholarship fund
rusting in the bank,&mdash;ripening, I had better say, for
just some such occasion. I fancy, even, that the
school would be willing to trust you for your tuition.
But one thing is quite settled: you <i>are</i> to return. And
I will make that clear to Basil&mdash;to your grandfather.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir; you’ve been mighty good to me.”</p>

<p>“You have been mighty good to us&mdash;mighty good
<i>for</i> us, I may say,&mdash;my boy.... Good-bye now,
for the present.... And God bless you.”</p>

<p>In a moment or so Tony was gone. He found
Jimmie, Charlie Gordon, Teddy Lansing, and told
them the news. And then, after a few hasty farewells,
went to his rooms with Jimmie to pack. It was then
late in the afternoon. The packing was a sad business,
for he felt he must take everything. He would be
away five months; perhaps, despite the Doctor’s kind
prophecy, for good. As this possibility occurred to
him, he would stand now and then in the middle
of the room, with a coat or hat or what not in his hands,
and feel it was simply impossible to go on. Tears
would start in his eyes and trickle down his cheeks.
He had always liked the school, even in his bad moods
he had been loyal; but he had not known, he had not
realized, as few boys do at the time, how the school
had become a part of his very life, how intensely
his affections were centered there. And then&mdash;Mr.
Morris; the fellows, Jimmie, Teddy, Charlie, Kit&mdash;it
would be hard to leave without saying good-bye
to Kit&mdash;, Reggie!</p>

<p>He turned to Jimmie who had come in at the
moment with his arms full of Tony’s belongings that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
he had collected from various parts of the school,
locker rooms and the like. “Excuse me for a little
while, Jimmie old boy; I’ve got to run over and see
Reggie. I haven’t told him yet.” Tony had a pang
of regret that he had seen so little of Reggie of late,
“I’ll be back before long.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Jimmie dolefully. “I’ll go on
with the packing, if you don’t mind. Don’t be
long.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” said Tony.</p>

<p>He found Carroll fortunately in his own room in
the Old School. For once Reginald was studying,
and Tony could scarcely remember when he had
seen him so engaged. But the Sixth Former closed
his Horace with relief as he recognized his visitor
and kicked out a chair for him to sit down. “Well,
I am certainly glad you have come. Heaven knows
how long I would have kept at that futile exercise,
if it had not been pleasantly interrupted. But what’s
up, my boy, you look as if you had seen a ghost?”</p>

<p>Tony sat down on the chair that Carroll had pushed
out. “I have, Reggie,” he said, “I have just got a
letter from home; worse luck. My mother’s ill, and
I have to start south to-night.”</p>

<p>“Jove, that is hard luck! When shall you get back,
do you suppose?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I don’t think my mother is dangerously
ill, but she wants me. There’s been a mess
about money too. The old governor has written, and
says I may not get back at all&mdash;not this term any
way.”</p>

<p>“Not this term!” Reggie jumped up quickly, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the habitual languor of his attitude and movements
gone, and strode over to the window.</p>

<p>“No, I’m afraid not, Reggie.”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why&mdash;I’ll be gone next term, boy.”</p>

<p>“I know, old man.”</p>

<p>For a moment Carroll turned his back to Tony
and looked out of the window into the deepening
twilight, and was silent. There was a lump in his
throat that kept him from speaking.</p>

<p>“I’ve only a few minutes, Reggie, old boy,” said
Tony, at last. “I am leaving in an hour and I am
only half packed. I’ve got to say good-bye.”</p>

<p>Carroll turned at this: a pathetic smile was on his
lips. “It has come so suddenly, boy ... it’s kind
of taken the wind out of my sails.” He came over
then and took Tony’s hand in his. “Tonio, ...
I can’t say good-bye.... You’ll write to me ...
you will come back surely.... I’ll be at Kingsbridge
and often back at school.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, Reggie.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know, boy,” Reggie went on, still
holding Tony’s hand, “I can’t tell you what your
being here has meant for me&mdash;you and Bill. We
haven’t seen each other much this year, and I reckon
I’ve often seemed to you a poor sort of friend ... but,
to put it poetically, old chap, ... the light o’ my
heart goes out with you.”</p>

<p>Tony gripped the hand in his tightly at this. There
was a lump in his throat too.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Reggie.... I will write, and you be
sure to write to me. Tell me all that’s going on....
Have an eye on Finch, will you? Poor duffer!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“Poor duffer, indeed!” said Carroll, and then
added, “Poor me!” Their hands clasped tightly, and
then Tony was gone.</p>

<p>Reggie stood for a long time just as Tony had left
him. “One by one the lamps go out,” he murmured,
quoting a line from one of his own verses. He sighed.
“So runs, so runs the world away....” There was
a queer sharp pain at his heart. He sat down at
last and opened his Horace again, and began to read,
but the words conveyed no sense to his mind. He
threw his arms out once, and whispered softly, pathetically,
“Oh, Tony, Tony.... God bless you, boy;
God bless you!”</p>

<p>Back in Number Five Jimmie and Tony were
absorbed in the last stages of the packing. Morris,
to whom Tony had explained the occasion of his
going, had come in and was helping them. And his
presence went a great way to cheer them up, for
Morris refused for an instant, even in his own mind,
to consider the possibility of Deering not coming back.
He eased off their good-byes, and sent Lawrence over
to cheer up Carroll, whom he knew would feel it more
than the rest, for it was good-bye to Tony for him
as he was in the Sixth and would be at Kingsbridge
next year when Tony returned.</p>

<p>Deering said good-bye to Finch, quickly, quietly,
he had time for little explanation. Finch said nothing,
but died of despair within.</p>

<p>On the way down the corridor Tony passed Kit,
a generous word was on his lips, their eyes met for
a second, but Kit looked quickly away, and Tony
passed on. The opportunity for a reconciliation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
was gone. Morris drove in to Monday Port with the
boy and saw him off on the way-train for Coventry.
With persistent tact, he continued to treat the parting
as only a temporary one, and refused himself the
melancholy pleasure of saying much to his young
friend that was in his heart and that Tony might have
been glad to hear. It was better so, thought Morris.
The kind things could be written, if the need came.</p>

<p>There was a quick, short, strong grip of their hands
at last, and Tony climbed into the train. He stowed
his things in the empty car, and then went and stood
on the rear platform and waved his hand to Morris
as the train pulled out of the little station, and strained
his eyes to see the last of the master’s patient, kindly
friendly figure until darkness blotted out the vision.
The train was rushing through the outskirts of the
little town. Beyond the limits it ascended a steep
grade and ran along a high level plateau for a way,
and thence Tony caught a glimpse of the lights of the
school shining brightly from the far-away hill, wafting
him, it seemed, a friendly good-bye across the dark.
Suddenly the train plunged into a narrow cut in a
hill and Deering could see the lights of Deal no more.</p>

<p>At Coventry he had a dreary wait for half-an-hour
until the midnight express for the south lumbered
in and stopped on signal. As soon as he had boarded
the through train, he got into his berth, for he was worn
out with the wearisome journey from Monday Port
and with the excitement of the last seven hours. But
he could not sleep for a long time. When at last he
did fall into a fitful slumber, constantly disturbed
by the jolts and jars of the rushing train, it was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
dream bad dreams. Once it seemed to him, in the
dazed state between sleeping and waking, that he
was lying in his little bed at Low Deering, that he
was still a little boy of fourteen, and that the last
four years at Deal had been only a dream....</p>

<p>At Low Deering Tony found things almost as bad
as he had feared. His father, a genial, charming,
irresponsible creature&mdash;the unaccountable wild olive
that grows now and then on the stock of the good olive
tree&mdash;had rather more deeply than usual&mdash;for the same
sort of thing had happened before&mdash;plunged his family
into distress. He had ventured all his available
capital and more that he had borrowed, on the security
of his extravagant hopes and good intentions, from
his wife; staked it in a case where he stood to win
twenty-fold or quite overwhelmingly lose; and, as
not unfrequently happens, had lost. Then had followed,
as Tony could remember the horror of it all
at an earlier period of his boyhood, a trying disappearance
and a return in a mood of black melancholy
and idle remorse.</p>

<p>But the worst was over by the time he reached
home. Victor Deering, thanks to his father’s stern
but tender patience and his wife’s unfailing much-tried
devotion, was slowly recovering his normal
health, his irrepressible spirits, his habitual weaving
of futile plans and nursing of quixotic hopes. But the
process this time had cost his family a good deal more
than its meager income could pay for and had sacrificed
Mrs. Deering’s health to worry and distress. For
weeks she had been lying in a state of nervous exhaustion,
from which the physician at last thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
she might be rallied if her wish were granted and Tony,
her only child, might be with her. And so he had been
sent for.</p>

<p>During those two hot months of the southern spring
Tony devoted himself to his mother, a devotion that
was only relaxed when later, the old general having
scraped together enough for the purpose, the family
removed for the summer to the cooler climate of a
resort in the North Carolina mountains. The mother
grieved not a little for her boy’s interrupted school
days&mdash;she guessed at the sacrifice Tony’s cheerfulness
hid,&mdash;but Tony and the General knew that his return
had saved her health if not her life.</p>

<p>Tony had been separated a great deal from his
family since he had gone north to school, so that, after
the first homesickness for Deal was over, he began
to be deeply interested again in the old scenes and
familiar friends of his early boyhood: the easy-going,
ill-managed old plantation with its extensive sugar
industry bringing in such income as they had; the
little hill on which stood the house of Low Deering,
low, white and great galleried; the sleepy bayou
that stretched away below to the wild and beautiful
jungle, a marshy live-oak forest, picturesquely hung
with the heavy lace of the gray Spanish moss and the
delicate purple of the wild wistaria; the inky black
darkies, relics of ante-bellum days; the few families
of similar decaying plantations in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Later in the summer at Bald Rock in North Carolina,
at the hotel to which their diminutive cottage
was attached, there were young people again&mdash;boys
to play baseball and climb the near by mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
with, girls with whom to dance at the Saturday night
hops on the great gallery of the hotel. Then too there
was his father. Despite an inner disapproval that
Tony could not help feeling for his father’s irresponsible
doings, for the trouble he now and then brought
so deeply, perhaps unwittingly, upon them all, Tony
enjoyed his father immensely. If he himself had
inherited his strong sense of honor and his manly grip
on life from his grandfather, and the inner patient
tenderness we have sometimes noted in him from his
mother, it was from his father that his charm, his
quick and ready sympathy, his genial grace had come.</p>

<p>After the terrible six months he had given them,
Victor Deering could not have done more to atone than
he was whole-heartedly trying to do. It was characteristic
of him, for he deeply appreciated what Deal
School had done for Tony, that his repentance should
have caused him to suggest to the old general that his
own patrimony, hoarded by the head of the house
against a rainy day, should be made over to Tony
at once, and the income, the capital if necessary,
be applied to completing his education at Deal and
later on at Kingsbridge. General Deering took his
son at his word. Victor was only too eager to promise
from then on steadfast attention to the plantation,
which, better managed, was capable still of recouping
their fortunes and furnishing them with a living.
So it began to look bright, as Tony wrote to Jimmie
Lawrence, for his return to school, and without any
question of taking advantage of scholarships or such
aid as the Head had so kindly offered. That offer
rankled, unjustly as he knew, in the old aristocrat’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
mind. He was determined Tony should have no such
humiliation to face.</p>

<p>Of the school in these days of Tony’s enforced exile,
a glimpse shall be had through the medium of Jimmie
Lawrence’s letters, for, of course, the two boys had
written each other with some regularity.</p>

<p class="pr4 p1">“<span class="smcap">Deal School</span>: <i>May 10th</i>.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pn">“<span class="smcap">Dear Tony</span>:</p>

<p>“Well, old boy, how does it seem to be getting Long Vacation
two months ahead of time? I am glad to know that your mother
is better; but I shan’t be contented again till you tell me definitely
that you will be back next term....</p>

<p>“I suppose you want to know what has been going on here. You
won’t be surprised if I say pretty much the same old thing. It is
lively enough to be in the thick of it, but there doesn’t seem much
to write about. I have naturally seen rather more of Kit since you
have been away, and though he does not say much if I try to talk
about you, I can’t but think that things must be all right between
you next fall. I have been seeing too a lot of Reggie Carroll.
Reggie, I suppose, will be the same lanky languid critter to the
end of the chapter, but Bill dropped the word to me the other day
that he has tremendously bucked up in his work, and that he’s
going in for the Latin Prize. I happen to know also that he is
hammering away on some verses for Jack Stenton’s prize in Poetry.
From the sample he read me the other night, I have no doubt
he’ll get it,&mdash;it is the real thing, not the style of the poems that
desecrate the pages of the <i>Deal Lit</i>. Reggie is going to turn out
O. K., Bill says; and I begin to think so myself. Though I must
confess, up to now, despite what you have always thought of him,
I have considered him rather poor pickings and considerably proud
of nothing. I haven’t seen much of Finch; he keeps pretty much
to himself; in fact hasn’t been in here since you left. Bill tells
me however that he’s to be back again next year.</p>

<p>“The team is developing in a satisfactory sort of way, and Teddy
makes a pretty good captain. I’m playing first as usual. We have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
won all our games so far, and I guess we’ll give Boxford a good
rub on June 10th. It’s a shame you won’t be here.</p>

<p>“There’s not much faculty news. Gumshoe’s Gumshoe! His
rooms have been rough-housed several times lately, and from the
way he glares at Kit, I fancy, he thinks he is responsible. Kit,
characteristically, retaliates by veiled impudence that sets the
Gumshoe’s teeth on edge. But he champs and says nothing.</p>

<p>“The fellows ask about you a lot, and send their best. Let me
hear from you soon, and don’t forget you are to spend the last
month of the vacation with me at Easthampfield. Write soon.</p>
</div>

<p class="pr6 reduct">“Ever affectionately,</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct">“<span class="smcap">Jimmie</span>.”</p>

<p class="p1">In June there came another letter that interested
Tony very much.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Reggie has pulled both the Latin and the Poetry Prizes. Even
the Gumshoe thawed a trifle and shook hands with him as he came
down from the platform on Prize Day, with a set of Browning in
his arms and the Jackson medal in his inside pocket. He’s so
blamed clever that he has got a <i>cum laude</i>. Bill beams with pride
over him. The President of Kingsbridge, a funny old chap who
talks through his nose and has a wit as keen as a razor, made us a
bully talk, and the Doctor announced the prefects for next year&mdash;curiously
enough he said the Head Prefect will not be appointed
until the opening of school in September. We all suppose, of
course, that that means you, and that it is only postponed until
it is certain that you are coming back. The other prefects will be
Teddy, Gordon Powel, Doc Thorn, Ned Clavering and myself.
I had hoped Kit would be one, but he’s been too independent I
guess. It’s a pretty good lot of fellows, I think, though I say it as
shouldn’t, and with you at the head, we ought to run things very
much as we want to next year....”</p>

<p class="p1">Tony had scarcely thought of the Head Prefectship
since he had left school. He believed that there
were others better fitted for it than himself and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
more deserved it. The fact that he was President
of the Dealonian made him an obvious candidate,
of course; and certainly if the authorities thought him
up to the position he would be glad to have it. The
possibility from this time on added to the keenness
with which he looked forward to his return in September.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE HEAD PREFECTSHIP</p>

<p>A warm bright September day at Deal. A golden
light from the western sun fell athwart the green fields
of the school and cast great shadows upon the beach
and the tranquil bay beyond. It had rained the day
before, after a long drought, so that the air was fresh
and the foliage had taken on a gayer green. The
long white Port Road leading down the hill toward
Monday Port was dotted with hacks, flies, barges,
coming to and returning from the school, each one depositing
at the terrace steps a somewhat noisy and
merry contingent of boys. They, after greeting the
Doctor and Mrs. Forester in the great hall, scattered
to their quarters to stow their belongings and compare
animated notes with their friends.</p>

<p>From an angle of the Old School, where he was
screened from view by a mass of shrubbery, Jacob
Finch lay flat on his stomach, his peaked face in his
hands, and his thin little legs, half hidden now by
long trousers, kicking in the air behind him. Below
him, descending terrace by terrace and over the
green sloping fields, stretched the wonderful Deal
country, so fresh and wind-swept, gleaming in the
mellow afternoon light; he looked out over the curving
tawny beach, the great sweep of the greenish-brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
marshes, the grayish-green of the dunes, the still sheet
of opaque water under the ledges of Lovel’s Woods;
and beyond the great fan-shaped curves of Strathsey
Neck, the rocks, the islands, and at last the boundless
expanse of the ocean, blue this afternoon as an Italian
lake. It was an afternoon to remember, to feel glad
for from a sense of its sheer beauty.</p>

<p>But Finch was totally unconscious of the scene
before him. Instead his eyes were fastened with an
intent gaze upon the white road and the long driveway
that divided the playing-fields. He eagerly scanned
each vehicle as it approached and deposited its
load at the flight of steps that led up to the principal
terrace. Each time an expression of disappointment
would settle upon his face, until it was transformed
again to eager interest at the approach of another
carriage.</p>

<p>Finch had spent the summer at Deal, so perhaps
there was little reason for him to become enthusiastic
over a prospect of beauty of which he had had so many
opportunities for growing weary. As he looked back
on the spring term, he hardly knew how he had got
through it. He lived during its last six weeks more
than ever in his shell, studying desperately to pass his
examinations. And in that he had succeeded.</p>

<p>After Deering’s departure and his own exposure
before Wilson, he avoided every one, even Lawrence
and Mr. Morris. And save on two or three occasions,
after a more bitter jibe than usual in the classroom
when he revenged himself on Mr. Roylston, he gave
up his secret vandalism. During the summer he stayed
on at Deal. The time had gone pleasantly enough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and had he been able to recoup his health, he might
have been restored to an equable frame of mind, but
unfortunately he was physically as miserable as ever.</p>

<p>By the middle of August he began to worry about
the possibility of Deering not coming back. After
a letter or so, which characteristically he had left
unanswered, he heard nothing from Tony. In August
he heard, however, from Doctor Forester, who was
spending a week-end with the Lawrences at Easthampfield.
“You will be interested to learn,” he had
written, “that your friend Anthony Deering is here
with James, and that there is now no longer any doubt
of his returning to school in September. I look forward
to great things from him as leader of the school.”
From that time on Finch lived from day to day on the
expectation of Tony’s return. He was thrilled by the
implied statement of the Head Master’s letter that
Tony would be appointed Head Prefect, though he
could not imagine that any other boy had for a
moment been seriously considered. Several times the
first day of the term when he had heard the boys
discussing the probability of Tony’s return and appointment,
he smiled to himself with secret glee and
a strange feeling of self-importance at his inside
information. But he said nothing. It pleased him
though that almost all of the boys seemed to take it
for granted.</p>

<p>At last, on that lovely September afternoon as Jake
lay under the bushes on the Old School terrace, he
was rewarded for his long vigil. In one of the last
of the many carriages that drove up, he saw Lawrence
and Deering. The rays of the setting sun were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
shining on the top of Tony’s bare copper-colored head
and made it glow like burnished gold. To Jake’s
adoring eyes it was as the halo about the head of a
patron saint. He watched the two boys clamber out
of their hack, pay the driver, and join a merry crowd
of fellows who were unofficially welcoming late
arrivals. “Hello Tony!” “Hello Jim!” “Well, I’m
mighty glad to see you!” With such cries he heard
fresh young voices ring; and with bright eyes, he followed
his hero as he entered the doors of the Old
School in the midst of a happy crowd of his classmates.
Through the window, to which he crept, he saw the
cordial greeting that Tony and Jimmie got from the
Doctor and Mrs. Forester. A moment later Finch
saw Kit Wilson enter, and heartily greet every one
except Tony. He sent a glance of vindictive hatred
toward Wilson that it was well for him Kit did not see.</p>

<p>About half-an-hour after supper Jake tapped
timidly at the door of Number Five study. In response
there came a hearty “Come in.”</p>

<p>“Why, hello, Finch,” cried Tony, grasping his
visitor’s hand with a strong grip, “I declare, you’re
getting fat.”</p>

<p>Finch laughed ruefully. “Not very, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, old chap, how have you been? Why the
deuce haven’t you ever written to me?”</p>

<p>“I dunno; I’m no hand at writing, I guess. I was
glad to hear from you though.”</p>

<p>“How goes it? Where have you been all summer?”</p>

<p>“Here,” answered Finch laconically.</p>

<p>“Here! what on earth were you doing here?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t have money enough to go any place else.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
The Head gave me some work in the library, cataloguing
books.”</p>

<p>“Good for him! I ought to have been working
myself, I reckon. Money’s been pretty scarce down
our way too. By Jove, old boy, it’s good to be back,
you know. You don’t know how much you care for
the old shop till you leave it.”</p>

<p>“No, I guess you don’t,” was Finch’s ambiguous
reply.</p>

<p>“Well, Jake, we’re going to have a good year this
time anyway. I’m going to pull you out of the dumps
instanter. Jimmie says you’ve been cutting Number
Five since I’ve been away. That won’t do.” He looked
about him with undisguised pride and pleasure.
“Things do look pretty nice and comfy in the old
camp-ground, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“They certainly do look good for you, Deering.
You’ll be Head Prefect.”</p>

<p>“Stop your kidding, Jake.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know you’ll get it,” said Jake. “I guess
it would have been announced all right last spring
if you hadn’t been so sure you mightn’t come back.
But it’s all right now.”</p>

<p>“Well, to tell the truth,” rejoined Tony with a
laugh, “of course I hope it’s all right. It’s a sort of
a turn-down when a President of the Dealonian
doesn’t get it. But there are other chaps that deserve
it on other accounts much more than I do. There’s
Ned Clavering and Doc Thorn. They are the right
sort. We’ve never been very thick but there aren’t
two fellows in the school that I have more respect for.
I reckon if I hadn’t made that lucky run in the Boxford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
game and been elected President of the Dealonian
soon after, that Ned would have had a better chance
than I. Fact is, I really never thought of being Head
Prefect till I had that election thrust upon me.”</p>

<p>“Clavering and Thorn are prefects all right. But
you are to be head. The Doctor told me so himself.”</p>

<p>“The deuce he did!”</p>

<p>“Honest. He wrote me a letter about my being
here last summer while he was at Easthampfield,
staying with Mr. Lawrence. He said you were there
with Lawrence, and then told me that you were to be
Head Prefect.”</p>

<p>“That’s funny. But if it’s so, why of course I’m
mighty glad. As far back as I know anything about
the school there have only been three Presidents
of Dealonian who were not Head Prefect in their
Sixth Form year. However, it means a lot of responsibility
and knocks out chances of a heap of fun.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re up to it,” said Finch with conviction.</p>

<p>“If I get it, I’ll certainly try to make good. But
as a matter of fact I haven’t got it yet. Tell me how
things went last year? How’s the dear old Gumshoe?”</p>

<p>“Same as ever. I hate him.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut, my child; there’s mighty few people
worth hating.”</p>

<p>“He is,” said Jake without a smile. “He’s a sneak.”</p>

<p>“Now, as a matter of fact, Jake, I don’t think he
is. The Gumshoe, as I have reason to know, can be
uncommonly mean, but I don’t believe for a minute
that he’s a sneak. I am coming by degrees, reflection
bein’ aided by merciful separation, to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the Gumshoe’s point of view: it’s pinched and peaked,
but it isn’t sneaky&mdash;he is just as disagreeable to your
face as he possibly can be behind your back. He’s
had a hard row to hoe, and I don’t blame him now
and then for being crabbed and sour. But I reckon
he takes it out in that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he does,” said Finch quite unconvinced
by Tony’s more generous reasoning. “I don’t
think so at all. He’d strike in the dark. I don’t
trust him.”</p>

<p>“Reggie never would either,” Tony mused for the
moment; then more cheerfully, “But come, let’s talk
of something pleasant. How&mdash;&mdash;Why, hello, Ted.”
This last exclamation was directed at a drab comical
face and ruffled head of mouse-colored hair that
thrust itself through the half-open doorway. “Come
in, you duffer.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t know you were busy,” said Teddy Lansing,
entering.</p>

<p>“Well, I ain’t,” said Tony.</p>

<p>Finch rose from his seat on the window-sill and
sidled toward the door. “I guess I’ll be going,” he
said to Deering, and bolted.</p>

<p>“Now, what the deuce is the matter with him?”
exclaimed Tony. “He shies at his shadow.”</p>

<p>“Pah&mdash;Pinch!” Teddy spat with emphasis at
the waste paper basket.</p>

<p>Tony looked up quickly, but restrained the impulse
of annoyance. “What’s the matter with
Finch?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing particular. I just don’t like him.
He’s a sneak. But there, I beg your pardon, Tony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>”
Teddy caught himself, remembering the cause of
Deering’s quarrel with Wilson. “I suppose you will
stand up for him. I don’t know much about him;
but he got on my nerves last spring to a degree. Guess
he’s bug-house.”</p>

<p>“He has had a blamed hard time here&mdash;that accounts
for it. But I don’t think he is a sneak. If we
had given him half a chance&mdash;&mdash;.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know, old chap; you’ve certainly given
him more than half a chance, and if you think it
pays, all right all right. I think, you know, that
Pinch isn’t worth the trouble you’ve taken with
him. But I’ll admit that I had no right to call him a
sneak. However he hasn’t made good here.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” said Tony. “But I wish he could.
Where’s the crowd?”</p>

<p>“Unpacking, I guess. What sort of a summer
have you had, old man? We missed you a lot here
last spring.”</p>

<p>“Bully&mdash;I was down in the mountains, North
Carolina. Where were you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, home mostly. Confound! there’s the bell for
Chapel. Come on, let’s wander down.”</p>

<p>The two boys made their way, arm in arm, through
Standerland corridors, across a moonlight-flooded
campus to the Chapel. At the entrance they came
face to face with Mr. Roylston; he gave them a
short greeting and passed rapidly within. Tony
was in high spirits, and waited outside until the last
moment, greeting boys he had not seen and an occasional
master. He could not help wondering, as
he took his seat with a feeling of pride in the Sixth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Form rows, if the Doctor would announce who was
to be Head Prefect that evening.</p>

<p>But he did not. After the customary short service,
an adaptation of Evening Prayer from the Prayer-book,
the Head made a few general announcements,
including a faculty meeting that evening, and then
gave the boys a talk. Doctor Forester was at his best
in Chapel. There was a simplicity in his sermons and
addresses, a rugged kindly earnestness, lit up by
occasional flashes of insight and vision, that made
him from the Chapel pulpit a genuine moral and
religious force amongst his boys. His theme that
evening was the Power of Kindness as a source of
happiness and goodness in the life of the school.
Tony, as he listened, felt a pang of remorse for his
jibes at Mr. Roylston and a keen sting of regret
for his difference with Kit; otherwise, on the whole,
he thought, he did try to be kind. And he liked what
the Doctor said because it put his own views into
much better, clearer terms than he could have given
them.</p>

<p>Tony, though he had absorbed much of the best
that the school and the strong men who made the
school could give him, had not consciously been deeply
touched or drawn to the religious life of the place.
He said his prayers at night; once in a long, long time
he read his Bible; he tried to do his duty mostly,
he wanted usually to be kind; indeed he usually was
kind; and, thought little more about it. His family
were all churchmen and he supposed that some time
he would be confirmed, but he had not yet been, and
indeed had never understood what it was that drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
people, especially boys of his age, toward a more personal
religion. But to-night, the old familiar hymns,
sung with such hearty good will; the gracious cadences
of the well-known prayers and psalms; the sense of
dependence upon and communion with a Higher
Power that breathed in the Doctor’s talk to them:
and particularly the soft singing in Latin of an old
monastic hymn, set to a Gregorian rhythm which the
boys always sang at evening services in the Chapel:&mdash;to-night,
it all touched him more intimately and deeply
than it ever had done before.</p>

<p>“I think I will be confirmed this year, Jimmie,”
he said to his room-mate, as they strolled across the
campus in the soft night, with their arms about each
other’s necks.</p>

<p>“I wish you would,” Jimmie replied, somewhat to
his surprise. “I was confirmed last spring, and I’m
mighty glad I was.”</p>

<p>They fell then into intimate talk&mdash;of themselves,
of the summer, of their plans for the year....</p>

<p>While the boys of the school were busy that evening
with their unpacking and the setting of their rooms
to order, under the supervision of the younger masters,
the senior members of the faculty were gathering
for their first meeting of the term in the Masters’
common-room. This room was directly back of the
library. Its windows opened eastward on to the
terrace, and commanded a superb view of the moonlight-flooded
sea and shore. The windows were
opened to the night air, and the fragrance of the late
honeysuckle drifted in on the soft breeze.</p>

<p>Doctor Forester was the last to enter. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
stopped a moment in the library to speak with Finch,
who was reading there.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jacob,” he said, pausing as if he suddenly
recollected something, “do you chance to remember
a letter I wrote you last summer from Easthampfield
when I was staying with Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, I just wish to caution you not to repeat any
remark I seem to recall having made there about this
year’s Head Prefect. I want it to come as a surprise to
all the boys, as well as to the boy I think I mentioned.
But the appointment is not made yet&mdash;it is always
done in conjunction with the masters.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>The Doctor passed on into the common-room.</p>

<p>In a few moments he had settled himself behind the
big table, and glanced about over his glasses at his
colleagues, to see who was present. About thirty
members of the faculty were there, including all of
the senior masters. Morris was standing with a little
group by the fireplace. Mr. Roylston was sitting by
the window looking out upon the moonlit sea.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, will you please come to order.” The
Doctor paused for a moment while they settled into
various attitudes of attention. “I have called you
together to-night to settle with your advice the question
of the Head Prefectship. I have seldom postponed
this appointment until after the Long Vacation,
but last June the boy who seemed to have most claim
to the place left school and it was doubtful for the
time if he would return. I may say, that I should have
appointed him even with that doubt unsettled, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
not one of the senior masters particularly requested
me to postpone the appointment until this fall.”</p>

<p>He paused again, and looked about him. “There
is no reason for further delay. The obvious candidate
for the position is, of course, Anthony Deering. He
was, as you all know, not only the president of the
Dealonian Society, which according to tradition registers
the boys’ choice of their leader, but he was
unanimously nominated to me by the retiring prefects
of last year’s Sixth Form. I may say at once, that
unless there is strong reason to the contrary, that I
am disposed to confirm that nomination this evening.
He is a boy who has been keenly interested in most of
the school activities and he has shown ability and
capacity for leadership in most of them. Personally,
as we all feel I imagine, he is a charming lad, high bred,
coming of one of the best old southern families; and,
as on several occasions I have had the opportunity
for judging, he has always displayed a sense of honor
and an attitude of unselfishness and kindness that is
as rare as it is delightful. I should be glad, however,
to hear your comments on the nomination, or to have
the merits of any other boy discussed whom you may
feel is entitled to consideration.”</p>

<p>After a moment’s silence, Stenton addressed the
masters. “Doctor Forester,” he said, “I should like
to say that I thoroughly agree with all that you say
about Deering. I have observed him at close quarters
on the athletic field, and I never knew a squarer,
more plucky lad. As you know, other things being
equal, I believe that an athlete should have preference
for the Head Prefectship. Two years ago I doubted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
if Deering would fulfill his athletic promise, but his
exploit in the Boxford game of last year, thoroughly
re-established his athletic reputation. I think he is,
simply because of his genial character and general
popularity, better adapted to the position than Ned
Clavering, the football captain, who would be my
next choice. He too is a fine chap, and though he
lacks Deering’s attractiveness, he is not so quick and
impulsive.”</p>

<p>“His impulses,” asked the Head, “are usually
generous, are they not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think they are,” Stenton replied. “He is
decidedly my choice.”</p>

<p>“And you, Mr. Morris?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, sir; I fancy my opinion of Deering
is well known. He has faults. He is impulsive, as
Stenton says; he is quick and he has a sharp temper.
But granting that, I am frank to say that he is a boy
whom it has been a privilege as well as a pleasure to
know. I think not merely that we would make no
mistake in selecting him for Head Prefect, but that
we could not possibly find another boy who would
do so well.”</p>

<p>“That is very much my impression,” said the
Doctor. “Unless&mdash;yes, Mr. Roylston.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say,” interrupted Mr. Roylston,
from his seat on the window-bench, in low distinct
tones in which there was discernible but a trace of
feeling, “I am sorry to say there is an ‘unless.’ I
regret very much to utter a discordant note to the
chorus of praise that has been sounding for the boy
whose name is under our consideration, but a sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
of duty as well as deep personal feeling impels me to
say that I should regard it as a calamity of injustice
if he should receive this appointment.”</p>

<p>The men turned with amazement and curiosity
in the direction of the Latin master. “My experience
of him,” that gentleman continued, “though it has
scarcely been as intimate as that of Mr. Stenton or
Mr. Morris,&mdash;both of whom, I understand, believe
in as well as practice, cultivating intimacies with
boys,&mdash;but it has been as extended. And never, I
desire to say, in my long experience have I had as
much trouble or been subjected to such impertinence
and insult as by Deering and his satellites.”</p>

<p>Doctor Forester interrupted his assistant master
a little impatiently. “I should be obliged if you will
specify some of his delinquencies, Mr. Roylston.”</p>

<p>“I fear I should exhaust your patience,” replied
the master, “if I attempted to detail the difficulties
to which I have been subjected. I shall content myself
with but one instance which was the culmination
last spring of a long series of annoyances.”</p>

<p>All of the men in the room were now giving
Mr. Roylston an undivided attention. All were surprised
except Beverly; even Morris looked at him with
open-eyed amazement. They knew, of course, that he
had had what they regarded trifling disciplinary
troubles with Deering and his friends,&mdash;a lively crowd,
especially in their Lower School days,&mdash;but they had
no reason to suspect that the master would take such a
definitely hostile attitude in a matter that seriously
affected a boy’s school life. Doctor Forester had
had some slight intimation, as it had been Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Roylston who urged the postponement of the appointment.</p>

<p>“Some time last year,” continued Mr. Roylston,&mdash;“in
March, to be more exact,&mdash;I had some difficulty
with Deering and Wilson, who were then chums,
though I believe that Wilson has since formed other
associations. They broke a gating that I had imposed
upon them, and when the matter was referred to the
Head Master,&mdash;unwisely, I thought, as I trust I may
be pardoned for saying,&mdash;their disobedience was not
punished. From that time on I do not think that I
am mistaken in saying that I marked a bravado in
their attitude toward me that was just short of
impertinence. I did not relax my vigilance, so there
were no more overt acts of disobedience. However,
they had what I suppose they considered their revenge.
One day in first study I confiscated from the boy
Finch a composition entitled ‘The Spectacle.’ Upon
examination it proved to be a somewhat coarse
imitation of Addison’s Spectator.” Mr. Roylston
drew a copy of Tony’s unfortunate composition from
his pocket. “The particular number that fell into my
hands was entitled ‘Soft-toed Samuel.’ With your
permission, sir, I should like to read it to the faculty.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” assented Doctor Forester, “if you
think best. If you prefer&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I do prefer, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very good&mdash;read it, by all means.”</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston slowly unfolded the paper, adjusted
his spectacles, and read to his colleagues Tony’s
effusion. He read it well, did full justice to the sarcasm,
the animus that had been in the writer’s mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
at the moment of composition. Some of the men,
conscious of the invasion it made upon magisterial
dignity, were plainly in sympathy with Roylston’s
indignation; others found difficulty in concealing their
enjoyment of its wit, and a little perhaps, in hiding
their satisfaction in seeing a colleague, none too popular
with themselves, held up to ridicule.</p>

<p>As Mr. Roylston concluded, he folded the paper and
handed it to the Head Master. “That, sir,” he said,
“is a copy of the original which was in Anthony
Deering’s handwriting, and the authorship of which
he acknowledged.”</p>

<p>Doctor Forester took the poor <i>Spectacle</i> into his
hands and glanced at it. “This is, of course, very
distressing; very unfortunate; a <i>most</i> unfortunate
occurrence.”</p>

<p>Morris spoke up quickly. “May I ask, Mr. Roylston,
if Deering did not apologize for this thing and
show genuine regret?”</p>

<p>“For its discovery, yes,” answered Mr. Roylston
dryly, as he met Morris’s keen glance with a stare
of scarcely concealed dislike.</p>

<p>“No, not for the discovery; for the thing itself,
I mean,” said Morris.</p>

<p>“He apologized, of course. There was nothing else
he could do as the evidence was perfect. As for
contrition, you, perhaps, are a better judge of that
than I.”</p>

<p>Morris flushed. “Deering has never mentioned the
matter to me, Mr. Roylston. I agree with you that
it is a flagrant impropriety and that it must have
seemed to you a gratuitous insult. But, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
it was not intended for your eyes, and I dare say, is
no worse than many another such squib as might
be directed at any of us by almost any boy. Their
sense of fun is doubtless often misdirected, but it is
only a sense of fun, I believe, and usually quite devoid
of malice.”</p>

<p>“My acquaintance with Deering, Mr. Morris, has
not been of so happy a nature as yours. I am not able
to believe that he is devoid of malice.”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” interrupted the Head, “I should be
glad to hear anything you have to say on the subject.
I appreciate Mr. Roylston’s very natural feeling. I
hope very much, however, that he may see with
me that it is one of those unfortunate incidents
which&mdash;&mdash;.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, sir,” exclaimed the master, “if I
define my attitude precisely. It will prevent misunderstanding.
I have reflected on this matter for six
months. I can only say that should the Head Master
and the faculty of this school reward with the highest
honors a boy who so deeply has insulted a member
of the faculty, thus seeming to stamp with their
approval a quite intolerable attitude of disrespect,
that I should be under the painful necessity of severing
my connection with the institution.” With that he
rose, bowed slightly, and excused himself.</p>

<p>Doctor Forester rose quickly. “Gentlemen, this
is evidently a more serious question than I had
supposed. I shall speak with Mr. Roylston alone,
and with your permission I will take the responsibility
of a decision entirely upon myself. I think we may
consider the meeting adjourned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>Had the masters that evening been less intent upon
what was going on within, sharp eyes, directed to the
clump of bushes immediately beneath the windows,
might have detected an eavesdropper on their proceedings.
But they did not, and when the meeting had
adjourned, he slunk, unobserved, away.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="pch">THE RESULT OF THE PROTEST</p>

<p>When Finch, for he was the eavesdropper, crawled
out of the bushes under the window of the Masters’
common-room, he darted quickly, keeping within the
shadow of the Old School wall, into a little clump
of trees beyond the terrace. He was stiff and sore
from lying motionless so long and had got thoroughly
chilled from the dampness of the ground. But his
mind and soul were at fever heat.</p>

<p>He had heard almost all of the conversation in the
room above him, and he was overwhelmed by the
course of events. He felt much as a general must
who receives the report of a spy informing him that the
enemy have augmented forces with which he cannot
hope to cope. Finch felt that he could not endure
the situation another minute. It had seemed that he
must shriek out more than once as Mr. Roylston had
so calmly, with such deadly determination, built
up his case against Deering. Finch felt his hero and
himself the victims of an ignoble conspiracy.</p>

<p>The boy had grown of late so accustomed to deceit,
that for the time being he absolutely forgot how contemptible
his own action had been and how it would
appear to others, to Tony. He was an Ishmael, and
felt himself justified in raising his hands against
every one because all hands seemed raised against him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
And his poor warped mind knew of no weapons except
deceit, trickery, eavesdropping, with which to cope
against the authority and success which were his
enemies. But now he was thinking of but one thing&mdash;the
position he so eagerly coveted for Tony was
threatened, and, thanks to the efforts of his inveterate
enemy, was apt to be given to another.</p>

<p>After pausing for a moment or so in the clump of
bushes, in which to gather together his shivering
body, he slipped off, entered the Old School by a
basement door, made a detour through the locker-rooms,
and emerged again in the north quadrangle.
He dashed across the campus and up the stairs of
Standerland to the door of Number Five study, and
knocked boldly, almost without knowing what he
was going to say to Tony.</p>

<p>Deering and Jimmie were within, with two or three
other boys. Finch gave a frightened glance about,
but for once he overcame his self-consciousness enough
to whisper at Deering, “Come over to my room, will
you? I want to see you particularly for a few minutes.”</p>

<p>Tony went to the door. “What is it?” he began.</p>

<p>“Please come over,” Finch continued. “I have
something important to tell you.”</p>

<p>Once in his own little room, Jake turned a white
excited face to Tony, his shyness was gone, absorbed
now by his passion of rage and anxiety.</p>

<p>“Well, what the deuce is up?” asked Tony, smiling
a little at his <i>protégé’s</i> agitation.</p>

<p>“A lot. There’s just been a faculty meeting. I
have heard all about it&mdash;it doesn’t matter how&mdash;but
all about it! and the Doctor put you up for Head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Prefect&mdash;and said all manner of fine things about
you&mdash;all the masters were there and they were all
going to vote for you&mdash;when Roylston&mdash;curse him!&mdash;got
up and told about <i>The Spectacle</i>, and read them
that copy of it he stole from me, and when he got
through he said he’d give up his job here if you were
made Head Prefect&mdash;and there was a lot of gas&mdash;and
the Doctor broke up the meeting&mdash;and said he’d
talk it over with Roylston. And then he went off.
And I don’t know what’s going to happen.”</p>

<p>“Here, here! what’s all this,” exclaimed Tony,
as Finch paused for breath. “You’re crazy, Jake.
Somebody’s been telling you a fairy story to get you
excited.”</p>

<p>“No, I am not crazy,” Jake replied. “I tell you
I know all about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, what the dickens is it? Say it over, will
you?”</p>

<p>Finch repeated, this time more accurately, all
that he had overheard. “He’s trying to queer you,”
he concluded, “that’s what! and he may do it, if we
don’t do something.”</p>

<p>“Jake, I say you are off your head. In the first
place, I can’t imagine the Gumshoe hating me quite
hard enough for that, and, in the second, I’m blamed
sure the thing has got twisted in being reported to
you.”</p>

<p>“It didn’t&mdash;I heard it&mdash;about it, I mean&mdash;I can’t
tell you who told me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t take much stock in it,” said Tony,
turning as if to leave. But Finch sprang forward,
and put his hand on Tony’s arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>“I take a lot of stock in it, I tell you. If you don’t
do something, you won’t get it.”</p>

<p>Tony wheeled around, his face blazing with sudden
anger, “What do you think I could do? Do you
suppose I’d turn my hand to get the thing? I’d cut
it off first. I haven’t asked to be Head Prefect, and
I don’t intend to ask to be, you poor fool.”</p>

<p>Finch scarcely winced before Tony’s anger. And
indeed it was gone as quickly as it came, almost
before Deering had finished speaking.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want the place?” Finch asked, with
a kind of wail of disappointment.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, of course, I <i>want</i> it,” answered Tony,
“but haven’t you got sense enough to see, that it
isn’t a thing a decent chap could work for, much less
ask for? Did you think I’d go over to the Doctor
and tell him that I think he had better appoint me
and let the Gumshoe go? I shouldn’t care very much
if he did go, but,&mdash;who told you about the meeting
any way? I can’t see why you shouldn’t tell me.
Was it a fellow?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A member of the faculty? not Bill? he wouldn’t
tell a thing like that.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I dunno.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you do&mdash;did you promise&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;happened to hear some of the faculty
talking.”</p>

<p>“Hear&mdash;where?”</p>

<p>“On the campus.”</p>

<p>“Overhear, you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I s’pose so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where were the masters you heard talking?”
Tony was putting his questions now rapidly and with
intention, for he had become suddenly suspicious.</p>

<p>“In the common-room,” Finch answered, beginning
to shake nervously again.</p>

<p>“Where were you?”</p>

<p>“Outside.”</p>

<p>“How could you hear all that outside? By Jove,
man, you were under the window listening?” Tony’s
voice took on a sharp note of contempt.</p>

<p>Finch shook like an aspen leaf.</p>

<p>“Answer me!” demanded Tony. “You weren’t
<i>trying</i> to hear, were you?”</p>

<p>No reply. Poor Jake moistened his dry lips.</p>

<p>“Pah!” exclaimed Deering. “So the fellows are
right, are they? you are a sneak?” He turned away
in disgust, and started across the room. His hand was
on the knob of the door, when Finch threw himself
in his way, and grasped him tightly again by the arm.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, Deering,” he cried in a queer
cracked voice, “don’t throw me over. You are the
only friend I’ve got. Don’t throw me over. I did
it for your sake. God knows I did.”</p>

<p>Tony stopped. He was appalled and bewildered
by the passion in poor Finch’s voice and attitude.
He turned back at last, and thrust Finch a little
roughly onto the couch. “Sit down there,” he said
gruffly. “I guess I’d better have it all out of you
right now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I’ll tell you everything,” whimpered
Finch. “Don’t throw me over.”</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">TONY WAS PUTTING HIS QUESTIONS NOW RAPIDLY AND WITH INTENTION FOR HE HAD BECOME SUSPICIOUS</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>“Shut up, and stop blubbering like a kid. I won’t
throw you over. But just at present I’m mighty
disgusted with you, I reckon you know.”</p>

<p>Finch drew his coat sleeve across his eyes, and caught
a sob or so in his throat. “I’ll tell you everything,”
he said, with a sniffle, “just wait a second.”</p>

<p>“All right. And mind you do tell everything,
if you ever want me to trust you an inch beyond my
nose again,” answered Tony. He suspected there
was a good deal to tell; in the last few moments a
multitude of little incidents flashed into his mind; all
were accounted for if Finch <i>was</i> a sneak.</p>

<p>“I know it was rotten, Deering,” began Finch,
“but I couldn’t seem to help it.”</p>

<p>“Now cut that sort of excuse out. Don’t try to
defend it. Just tell the truth, will you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I was sitting in the library reading, and
the Doctor passed through, and stopped a minute and
spoke to me, and told me not to say anything about
the letter he wrote me last summer in which he had
mentioned you as the leader of the school. He said
the appointment wasn’t made yet.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all, but I saw him go into the Masters’
room, and I guessed they were going to have a meeting
to discuss that very thing. It flashed into my head
that something was up; that something had gone wrong
about your getting it. I couldn’t help&mdash;I swear to
you I couldn’t help sneaking outside and trying to
hear. The windows were up, and I could hear almost
everything that was said inside. As I said, the
Doctor&mdash;&mdash;.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to hear anything more about that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>”
interrupted Tony, “I’m not an eavesdropper. I
don’t give a continental darn what you heard. If I
don’t get it&mdash;all right. If Roylston’s queered me,
that’s his business, I guess. He may think he has a
right to. Maybe he has. But just at present, what
I am trying to make you see is that what went on in
the faculty room isn’t your business nor my business,
and that to sneak and listen like that is low-down.”</p>

<p>Finch, poor chap, did not fully understand what
Tony was driving at. “All right, I guess it is,” he
said, with a bewildered air, “but I thought&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I don’t care what you thought,” said Tony.
“Do you see that was the act of a sneak? You called
Roylston a sneak earlier this evening&mdash;well, whether
he ever did a sneaky thing or not, you have just done
one, see?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see, of course, I see; but&mdash;&mdash;.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you see, all right. Now there’s something
else I want to get at. I want to know in what other
ways you’ve been sneaky around school. Did you
tell the Head that you had already told me about
this letter?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Did he ask you?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;not exactly&mdash;but I s’pose he thought I
hadn’t from my manner.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well let’s settle one or two other things,
Jake. Remember the time that Kit Wilson kicked
you out of his room last spring?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Finch was whiter than ever.</p>

<p>“Well, was it true&mdash;no, I mean, was Kit right&mdash;did
you go there to rough-house his room that night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” breathed Finch.</p>

<p>“Had you been rough-housing his room and desk
before, as he thinks you had?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” exclaimed Tony. “And you
lied to me! You let me quarrel with Kit, just because
I thought you were innocent and that he had been
hard on you and unfair! You let me lose one of my
very best friends, just because&mdash;by Jove, I don’t
understand you. It’s too rotten bad.”</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, Deering,” whimpered Finch,
“don’t throw me over!” and then sat, biting the tips
of his fingers.</p>

<p>Tony, wavering between anger, disgust and pity,
could scarcely trust himself to speak.</p>

<p>At last he asked, “Why didn’t you tell me the
truth that night when I asked you? Kit and I had
already quarreled, but if I had known then what you
had done to him, we could&mdash;&mdash;Why didn’t you tell me
the truth?”</p>

<p>“I was afraid you’d throw me over.”</p>

<p>Tony shuddered with an uncontrollable feeling of
repulsion. “Why did you want to play such low
tricks on Kit?”</p>

<p>“I hated him.”</p>

<p>“Why? Because he opposed your getting into the
Dealonian?”</p>

<p>“No, no, not that!” exclaimed Finch passionately.
“I didn’t want to get into the Dealonian.”</p>

<p>“Then, why?” Tony was nonplussed.</p>

<p>“Because he had broke with you.”</p>

<p>At last to his humiliation&mdash;it dawned on Tony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the depth, the tragedy, of Finch’s affection; the
complexity of his twisted, dwarfed nature; and anger
and contempt were swallowed up in pity. He stood
for a long time before the miserable lad without
speaking.</p>

<p>“Well, Jake,” he said at length, “it is pretty bad&mdash;awful
bad. I just hate to think of it.”</p>

<p>“What can I do?” asked Finch piteously.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you can do. I want to think
it all out before I talk with you any more. But if
I were you I’d get down on my knees and ask God
to forgive me.” Tony again put his hand on the doorknob.
“I am going. I have got to think it out.
I reckon you can see that you have been the cause of
a lot of trouble. Don’t worry about me, though. I
won’t throw you over in the way you think I might.
But I can’t talk about it any more now. Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Good-night,” said Finch, with a gulp.</p>

<p>He sat for a long time on the edge of his couch with
his face in his hands, staring blankly in front of him.
The world upon which his soul looked out was as bare,
as comfortless as his little room. He was dumbly
miserable. He knew he had hurt Deering, but just
how, he could not see. The fear that possessed him
chiefly was that Deering would throw him over. “And
I did it because of him,” he would say now and then
between his clenched teeth. He could not understand
Tony’s horror of the deceit, he could not fathom his
unwillingness to take advantage of the information
which he himself had risked so much to obtain.
He knew of course that he had done a wicked thing,
but the wickedness seemed almost justified because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the temptation had been so strong. He was sorriest
about Wilson. As for the eavesdropping&mdash;when he
thought of that, he clenched his fists. If Roylston
were successful! I may be a sneak, he thought, but so
is he. All was fair in war&mdash;and if Tony didn’t get
the Head Prefectship, whatever Tony might say or
feel, war it should be. “I’ll show him,” he muttered,
conjuring up the vision of Mr. Roylston reading <i>The
Spectacle</i> to his colleagues. “If he queers Deering,
I’ll get even with him whatever happens!”</p>

<p>When Tony returned to Number Five study he
found that the boys had left and that Jimmie had
gone to bed. He undressed slowly, trying to think
out the situation. Of course, he had misjudged Finch
almost from the first, he realized that. The others
were right. He was a difficult case, too difficult for
a place like Deal. He could not have believed, had
he not heard it from the boy’s own lips, that he could
stoop to such methods for revenge. But there it was!
He had an actual situation to deal with; a living soul,
just so tempted, so weak, so corrupted by misery,
to help or hurt now by fresh judgments, which might
be right or wrong. That he had been too generous
before toward Finch, was no reason, however, with
Tony, even for a moment, why he should be ungenerous
now. He must do his best. He hoped Finch would
be willing for him to talk it all over with Mr. Morris.</p>

<p>After a time, as he lay in bed, sleepless and still
feverishly thinking, his attention wandered from
Finch to his own case, to the facts, that, much as
he wished to close his mind to them, were very much
there. It was hard to believe that Mr. Roylston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
was so bitterly hostile, so absolutely unforgiving. His
own conscience had long ceased from troubling him
about <i>The Spectacle</i>, and he wondered if the Head
could take Mr. Roylston’s point of view. He had
forgiven himself in that matter so completely, that
he could hardly realize how it still rankled with the
offended master, how it might impress others. At
last he fell asleep, quite assured that things would
right themselves and confident that on the morrow
he would learn that he had been appointed Head
Prefect.</p>

<p>He saw Finch in the morning on the way to Chapel,
and tried to greet him naturally. Finch seemed
stolid, unresponsive, but not keenly conscious, as
Tony had supposed he would appear, of what had
taken place between them the night before.</p>

<p>Finch had spent a sleepless night. But now he had
set his teeth and was waiting. He was staking his
all, as it were, on the Head proving <i>fair</i> as he called
it to himself. He was staking his reform, his remorse,
his repentance on the issue which, beyond his control
now by fair means or foul, depended on the Head.</p>

<p>The morning hymn was “I need Thee every hour,”
and Finch joined in it. He dumbly felt he was willing
to bribe heaven to gain his end. He looked about the
Chapel, and noted that Mr. Roylston was not present,
and his heart leaped with the thought that the master
had lost his case, perhaps even, Finch passionately
hoped, the Head had accepted his resignation. He
tried, but he could not listen to the reading of the
scriptures and the prayers. Then the Grace was said,
and the boys were settling back in their seats into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
attitudes of attention, for the Doctor was still at the
reading-desk as if he had something to say to them.</p>

<p>“There is still”&mdash;the Doctor’s voice seemed to Finch
to come from a great distance&mdash;“there is still an
important appointment to be announced. The Head
Prefect for the year will be&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>There was a slight disturbance in the back of the
Chapel&mdash;some one had dropped a hymn-book, and
the Doctor paused, it seemed to Finch for an intolerable
age.</p>

<p>“Edward Austin Clavering of the Sixth Form.”</p>

<p>Immediately there was a little buzz; then the boys
began pouring out of the Chapel. Finch sat still.
Outside he heard Doc Thorn calling for a cheer for
Clavering. At last, he pulled himself together and
went out. On the gravel walk boys were still congregated;
he passed Tony who was shaking hands at
the moment with Ned Clavering. “I say, Jake;
wait a second!” Tony called, catching sight of him;
but Finch, making no sign that he had heard, bent
his head and hurried on.</p>

<p>Jimmie Lawrence, however, was waiting for Tony
until with good grace he had finished his congratulations
to Clavering. A good many, as they poured
out of the Chapel that morning, watched with curious
interest the meeting between the successful and the
unsuccessful candidate. But from Tony’s manner,
the most critical could not have imagined a shade
of envy in his cordiality.</p>

<p>“It is a downright shame!” exclaimed Jimmie,
when at last Tony joined him. “It is an outrage.
I can’t understand it&mdash;why&mdash;!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>“Careful, Jim, careful. Deuce take it, I do feel a
bit sore, but then I reckon Ned Clavering has as good
a right to it as I have.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he has, other things being equal; but they
are not equal. You were nominated, the school
wanted you, everybody expected you would get it:
there is not a single reason why you shouldn’t have
it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps there is,” protested Tony. “We’ve all
been in scrapes now and then. We weren’t always
the angels we are now, Jim.”</p>

<p>“Likely not, but I notice they didn’t hold up my
ante-angelic days against me. Why, you aren’t even
a prefect, do you know it?”</p>

<p>“By Jove, I’m not, am I?” exclaimed Deering.
That fact until then had not occurred to him.</p>

<p>“There’s something fishy behind it, mark my words.
I wish we could find out what it is.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we shall,” said Tony. “But anyhow, I’m
not going into a grouch over the affair.”</p>

<p>“Nobody wants you to, but I wish you would show
a little more sense of the rotten way you have been
treated. By Jove, Tonio, I have it! it’s the Gumshoe!”</p>

<p>Tony found no answer to this exclamation, but
Jimmie, excited by his theory, did not wait for one.
“D’ye remember Reggie Carroll telling us that the
Gumshoe would get even?”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Why, after the show-up he got when you and
Kit licked Ducky Thornton and he took you two to
the Head for breaking his gating. And also after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
time Gumshoe soured on you about the Soft-toed
Sammy billet-doux.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember something of the sort. Perhaps
he is responsible. But anyway, kiddo, I’m dished,
and that’s a fact.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that Kit was one of us now, boy; wouldn’t
we get even?”</p>

<p>Tony sighed. “I reckon we would. But he isn’t!”</p>

<p>“No, worse luck! I wish&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>What Jimmie wished was left unsaid, for at that
moment Doctor Forester caught up with them, and
called to Deering. “Will you please stop at the
Rectory, Anthony, for a few moments? I want a
word with you.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir,” said Tony and waited for the Head,
as Jimmie, with a “So long,” hurried on to a first
hour recitation.</p>

<p>The Doctor was very cordial in his manner to Tony,
and waved him to a comfortable chair in his study
before he opened his conversation.</p>

<p>“I dare say,” he began, “that you, as were others,
were somewhat surprised to learn who is to be Head
Prefect this year.”</p>

<p>Tony flushed and looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“I do not mean,” went on the Head quickly, “to
suggest that you had no occasion for surprise. It is
an open secret, I fancy, that you were slated for the
position.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Tony, with some embarrassment,
“I had some reason to suppose that I was being considered.”</p>

<p>“More than that, I am frank to say,” continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the Doctor, “I had quite determined on your appointment.
I wish you to understand that I changed my
mind strictly with the understanding that the reasons
for the change should be thoroughly explained to you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I wish you to know that there is but one reason
why I have not chosen you for Head of the School.
The mild or mischievous infractions of discipline in
your younger days, I do not take into account. You
were concerned, I have learned, in fact, you were the
author of a squib in which one of the senior masters
was held up to ridicule.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Now,” continued the Head, finding it a little
hard to word his phrases exactly, “I agree with Mr.
Roylston, the master so caricatured, that that was
most reprehensible. I do not suppose you have
any defense for it.”</p>

<p>“None, sir. I can only say, while I now see how it
was calculated to be taken as an insult, I did it simply
for fun.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. It was not a matter that I myself,
taking all things into consideration, should have
regarded as a capital crime, but it has caused deep
offense to the master involved and he has not seen
his way to forgetting or perhaps even to forgiving it.
In fact, because of it, he has protested emphatically
against your appointment.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I repeat, I should myself have overlooked such
an offense&mdash;I should have accepted your apology
in the spirit in which I think it was given. But as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Mr. Roylston is unwilling to do so, I do not feel
that I should be justified in overruling his protest.
The same reason disqualified you as a prefect.”</p>

<p>Tony was silent.</p>

<p>“I need not point out to you,” the Doctor continued,
“that while I believe Mr. Roylston is severe, that I
do not think he is acting with any conscious injustice.”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I recognize his right to protest against
my appointment. I have not complained of your
decision, sir.”</p>

<p>“No, I know that you have not. I felt it due to you
that you should understand perfectly what interfered
with your appointment. I know also that I can count
on you for as loyal help as though you were a prefect.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much for what you have said
to me, Doctor Forester. I appreciate it. I am very
sorry that I hurt Mr. Roylston in the way I did.
Of course&mdash;I don’t say this as a defense for writing
what I did&mdash;I did not mean it to come under his
eyes. I apologized sincerely, and though I know
that Mr. Roylston did not believe in my sincerity,
I can see perhaps that it was difficult for him to do so.
As for my being loyal, I can’t see that this makes
the slightest difference one way or the other. I should
like to have been Head Prefect, but I should never
have thought of being chosen except for my election as
president of the Dealonian and my nomination by
last year’s prefects. I think Clavering will make a
fine Head of the School.”</p>

<p>“I trust,” said Doctor Forester, “that you will
not bear ill-will toward Mr. Roylston. He is acting
from conscientious motives, I am sure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“I shall try not to, sir.”</p>

<p>With that Tony rose, shook hands with the Head
Master, and took his leave.</p>

<p>Doctor Forester watched him as he walked across
the campus, at a brisk pace, head up, shoulders back.
“There,” he said, turning to his wife who had just
slipped into the room, “there goes a rare boy, my dear.
He has made it harder for me to do my duty than any
one I have ever known.”</p>

<p>“Tony Deering make it hard for anyone to do his
duty! Why, my dear, did you not appoint him Head
Prefect? Every one wanted him; every one expected
that he would be.”</p>

<p>“All but one of us, dear, who had a strong, if not
a fine reason, for objecting to him; but I would rather
not go into it, if you do not mind. Mark my words,
that boy now is the strongest boy in the school&mdash;all
the stronger for not having the position he ought to
have.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Forester smiled. “That is a comfort, at least,
to know. But I tell you, Henry, if we women had the
appointment to make, it would take more than one
strong reason to prevent our giving Tony Deering
anything he ought to have.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is fortunate then, my dear, that you
women have other things to do.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="pch">FINCH’S HOUR</p>

<p>For our friends the incident was closed. Jimmie
took his seat in the prefect meetings on Sunday
nights and solemnly assisted, with increasing interest,
in “running the school,” as the members of those
conclaves were accustomed to term their labors. Tony
acquiesced in the inevitable with a good grace, and
beyond discussing the matter in its various aspects,
with Jimmie and to some extent with Mr. Morris,
who was handicapped in expressing his opinion by
professional loyalty, he kept his mouth shut.</p>

<p>Others did not. Decisions of such a nature, important
to the life of a school, are rarely long kept
secret. And in this instance, the Head Master did
not resent the facts being known, though he himself
of course maintained an absolute reserve. The facts
were known sooner or later, and with a fair degree
of accuracy. And the knowledge increased neither
Mr. Roylston’s popularity nor his peace of mind.
Indeed he found himself increasingly unable to extract
comfort from the reflection that a deserved punishment
had been fearlessly administered or that in
being just he was as wise as if he had also been merciful.
During that term Mr. Roylston had many
bad quarters of an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>As for Tony, as Doctor Forester had predicted,
the loss of the Head Prefectship added to rather than
diminished from his strength among his schoolmates.
He became, quite naturally and spontaneously, the
unofficial adviser of the prefect body, and particularly
of Clavering, who made a point of consulting him
upon all important matters that came to the prefects’
notice. The effect of this generosity on Clavering’s
part was to reveal the two boys to each other and to
establish a firm friendship between them.</p>

<p>Clavering was a heavy, solid, serious-minded boy,
of a mighty frame and muscle, but slow, patient and
cautious in his thought and emotions. Until Tony
had become fairly intimate with him, he had never
appreciated his classmate’s deep and earnest character;
just as Clavering, until he got behind Tony’s light-hearted
genial pleasantness of manner and speech,
had not realized that there was anything there worth
while,&mdash;any seriousness of purpose, soundness of
feeling, or loyalty to principle. He had taken Tony
superficially, and was surprised in the course of the
term to find how much he had grown to like him;
how much, too, he was depending on Tony’s judgment
and feeling in the various matters with which
the Head Prefect in a large school may have to deal.</p>

<p>“I’m slow; you’re quick,” he said to Tony one
night. “I’m fairly sure, I suppose, when I make up
my mind,&mdash;but it takes me the deuce of a long time
to see things straight. You seem to see into a situation,
to know a fellow, right off.”</p>

<p>“Well, I dare say I’m quick, but I make lots of
mistakes, you know,” laughed Tony, pleased with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
compliment, especially coming from a boy who never
paid them.</p>

<p>“They don’t seem to count for much then,” was
Clavering’s reply. He forgot that one of Tony’s
mistakes accounted for himself rather than Tony
being the Head of the School.</p>

<p>“That is more comforting as a general proposition
than as an afterthought,” said Tony ambiguously,
and turned the subject of conversation to football.</p>

<p>In this field Clavering seemed an expert. And such
indeed he proved himself again on the gridiron that
fall, for Deal turned out one of the best teams that
Jack Stenton could remember, and that was paying
it very high praise. They won all their games, including
the one with Boxford by a score of 24 to 0, which
was the largest on record. Clavering was a tower of
strength to the team, and Tony, who had lost nothing
of his fleetness, again distinguished himself by some
brilliant, if not quite such dramatic runs as twice
before he had made.</p>

<p>Before the boys realized it the football season was
over, and the Sixth Form were looking forward to
their last Christmas vacation of school days. This
time Tony took Jimmie Lawrence to Low Deering
with him, and had the keen pleasure of initiating his
best friend into all the associations and delights of
his home and country.</p>

<p>The Deering fortunes were in better shape, particularly
as Victor had kept his promise, and was
devoting himself with industrious zeal to the plantation.
The old general took a great fancy to Jimmie,
particularly he found a bond between him and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
boy in mutual literary tastes. The old man could
not lead a very intellectual life, but he reverenced
it and longed for it. The promise of Jimmie’s appreciation
and powers was to him peculiarly delightful. The
boys had a capital vacation, so that they were sorry
when it came to an end and they were back at Deal
again for the long winter term.</p>

<p>Since his confession Finch avoided Deering. He
felt self-conscious about his sentimental outbreak
against being “thrown over.” Tony certainly had
not thrown him over, but he did not see his way to
be with Finch anything more than persistently patient
and kind. Only once afterward was the subject of
their conversation of the night of the faculty-meeting
reopened.</p>

<p>“Of course, Jake,” Tony said, “you see, just as
well as I do, how absolutely wrong your actions were.
I am going to leave it entirely to you to set yourself
right with Wilson&mdash;right to the extent, at least, of
letting him know that you are sorry. He has been
mighty decent to keep quiet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he hasn’t kept quiet,” Finch rejoined sullenly.
“Most of your crowd&mdash;of his crowd, anyway, know
more or less about it. I have seen that all along.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps they do; I have not heard them
speak of it anyway. Kit can’t have told it very generally,
or I would have heard.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know&mdash;not after the row you had with
him about me. They all like you too much, except
Wilson, to give you a chance to get sore again. They
don’t think me worth bothering about.”</p>

<p>“Well, even so&mdash;you have given some cause for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
that attitude now. But I tell you what, I want to
get right with Kit again. Not, old chap, at the price
of throwing you over&mdash;don’t think that!&mdash;but, on
the other hand, I don’t want to make keeping on good
terms with you the price of Kit’s friendship. There
isn’t need. And can’t you see that I cannot be the
one to tell Kit the&mdash;to tell Kit about you?”</p>

<p>Finch did not see, but he kept silent. He appreciated
neither Tony’s deep feeling for his friend nor Tony’s
delicate consideration for him. He was thinking
dolefully of just how miserable and unfortunate and
unlovable he was. Yet, with all the ardor of his intense
famished little soul, he clung to Deering’s patient
tolerance, and mutely resolved to give him no chance
of “flinging him off.” But as for going to Kit with
the truth, that was an act of which he was incapable,
an act of which he was even incapable of perceiving the
point.</p>

<p>“I’m just worthless, Deering,” he said at last
miserably, “I’ll be thankful when it’s all over.”</p>

<p>“Now, cut that out, Jake. Get out and play with
somebody. Don’t mope round all the time; and come
in often and see us. Jimmie is glad to have you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Finch. He longed to open again the
conversation about the Head Prefectship, and learn
from Tony what he really felt about that, but with
dull shame for his baseness, he did not dare. And as
for Tony that was a subject that he felt he never could
discuss with Finch again.</p>

<p>Time drifted on. Finch continued to worship
Deering, but he avoided him more than he had done
before, and lived his own lonely, unhappy life, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
many a boy had done before him at school, with all
that young world around him, gay, spirited, uncaring.
Morris cared, but to his advances Finch proved adamant.
As the term advanced, in the inevitable distraction
to other interests and pleasures, it was only
natural that the attention Tony had concentrated
on Finch at the opening of the term, should have
slacked. After a time, growing used to seeing less of
him, even Tony began to feel that Finch was getting
on well enough, and ceased for the most part to worry
about him.</p>

<p>Finch had not forgotten his grudge against Mr. Roylston,
but rather nursed it with the tenacity of such
a nature, and took a gloomy pleasure in planning
from time to time impossible schemes of revenge.
For a long time Deering’s tranquillity with regard
to the Head Prefectship disarmed Jacob. It was
hard to resent for your hero what he himself did not
resent. But he nursed his grudge.</p>

<p>It happened along in January that the prefects
had occasion to deal with some disciplinary irregularities.
Being governed by Clavering’s advice, they
frankly mismanaged the case and involved two or
three boys in a somewhat unfair predicament. Clavering,
realizing that his judgment had been at fault,
appealed to Deering, who had the good luck to make
a suggestion that speedily set matters straight and
saved the school from rather a mess. The boys talked
over the affair quite generally, and as often happens,
they criticised Clavering somewhat sharply, spoke
indeed more harshly, most of them, than they really
felt. Finch overheard a discussion of the incident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
in the common-rooms which was concluded by Teddy
Lansing affirming rather loudly and tactlessly, “Well,
it was a rotten roast when Deering did not get the
Head Prefectship in the first place. Clavering is
a blundering old cow.”</p>

<p>“That it was&mdash;a rotten roast!” came in a sharp
staccato from a near-by corner. Finch had spoken,
impulsively, and quite unusually drawing attention
to himself.</p>

<p>“Yeaaaaa! Yeaaaa!” was returned in full chorus
which half jeered at the boy, half applauded his
sentiments.</p>

<p>“Bully for you, Pinch!” shouted Teddy. “You
stick up for your friend, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Friend or no friend,” answered Finch, with unwonted
boldness, “it was a roast. He was cheated
out of it.”</p>

<p>“Guess he was,” agreed another boy. “How’d
it come about, d’ye know?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” Finch answered, “but I’m not
saying.”</p>

<p>“Oh, inside information, eh?”</p>

<p>“If you want to call it that.”</p>

<p>“Who from&mdash;Tony Deering?”</p>

<p>Finch turned to his questioner with a vicious snarl.
“No, it wasn’t from Tony Deering. He don’t care.
It doesn’t make any difference to him, but it makes
a lot of difference to the school.”</p>

<p>“Well, who cooked his goose?”</p>

<p>“Who cooks everybody’s goose?” demanded Finch.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess, Pinch my boy, it don’t need a prophet
to answer that question,” Teddy responded. “Very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
likely it was the mild and gentle Ebenezer Gumshoe
Roylston. You’re right, I guess. But let me tell
you,” he added, as he pulled Finch aside, “Tony’s
the last person in the world who would thank you
for discussing his affairs in a crowd.”</p>

<p>Finch suddenly realized the truth of this remark,
hung his head, and sidled away. But this outbreak
on Tony’s behalf had excited him. It brought back
all the old hopes and fears, the old pangs of disappointment
and chagrin, and renewed his rage against
Mr. Roylston.</p>

<p>Not long after the conversation which has just
been reported, the mid-year examinations were held.
Finch, who still had difficulty with his Latin, had
studied particularly hard, and had practically crammed
by heart the translation of several difficult passages
from Cicero’s <i>Orations</i> upon which the Sixth Form
were to be examined. As soon as he entered the
examination room, over which Mr. Roylston was
presiding, and had looked over his paper, noting that
two of the passages he had so poled up were on it,
he quickly wrote them out on a separate piece of paper,
intending to write them into his examination book
at his leisure; then he bent laboriously to his task
of working out the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston, an argus-eyed examiner, eventually
observed from his desk that Finch was copying
something into his examination book from a detached
slip of paper. He strolled leisurely and softly about
the room and advanced down the aisle where Finch
was sitting from behind. As he reached the boy,
he glanced down over his shoulder, and saw what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
he was doing. He suspected, not without reason,
that Finch was not strictly honest in his work, and
the present circumstance, it must be confessed, had
all the appearance of cheating.</p>

<p>Without warning he reached over Finch’s shoulder,
and took the examination book and the sheet of paper
on which the translated passages of Cicero were
written from the hands of the astonished and frightened
boy. “You may leave the room,” he said, “and
report to me in my study to-night at eight o’clock.”</p>

<p>Finch looked up at him wildly. “What’s the
matter? What are you doing that for?” he exclaimed
excitedly.</p>

<p>“You understand perfectly well,” the master
replied sharply. “You are excused from this examination.
Leave the room! Do you understand me?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;!” began Finch, flushing crimson.</p>

<p>“Go!” repeated Mr. Roylston, pointing to the door,
heedless of the excited attention of the boys around.</p>

<p>The color fled from Finch’s face as swiftly as it
had come. He rose, threw down his pencil, and dashed
out of the room. Mr. Roylston folded the papers,
and then composed the schoolroom with a glance.</p>

<p>Finch was not seen about the school again that
day. At nightfall he returned from the Woods where
he had taken refuge, bought himself a bun or so at
the Pie-house, for he was nearly famished, and having
thus made a frugal supper, at eight o’clock he presented
himself at the door of Mr. Roylston’s study
in Howard House.</p>

<p>The master had no doubt in his mind that he had
detected a flagrant case of cheating, a crime that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
above all others abominable in his eyes. He bade
Finch enter, when he heard his soft knock at his door,
and then let him stand awkwardly a moment or so
while he examined him critically. The haggard face,
the hunted look, seemed to him those of a criminal.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he said at last, “you are here.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I am here,” Finch answered sullenly. “What
do you want with me!”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget yourself. Incidentally, I may say,
that you have involved yourself in an excessive
number of late marks, if not in more serious trouble,
by your prolonged absence to-day.”</p>

<p>“I’ll attend to that. What do you want with me?”</p>

<p>“In the first place, and instantly,” said Mr. Roylston
in acid tones, “I want a respectful demeanor.”</p>

<p>Finch bit his lips. “I’m sorry.... But I’ll
take what’s coming to me for being away to-day.
You told me to report to you at eight o’clock. I am
here.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” observed the master, “you are here. To
come to the point&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,&mdash;why did you take my examination
book?”</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston had not gauged the boy’s attitude
as yet. He supposed he would lie&mdash;that kind of a boy
usually did. He sought Finch’s weak troubled eyes
with a piercing glance. “I took it,” he said, in a cold
judicial voice, “because you were cheating.”</p>

<p>“I was not cheating!” Finch exclaimed passionately.</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston smiled patiently. “The evidence is
sufficiently strong as scarcely to admit of mistake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
You may affect to deny it; but I tell you candidly,
young man, I have suspected you before; and further,
you will scarcely be surprised to hear that I have very
little confidence in your word.”</p>

<p>Finch gulped. “I was not cheating!” he repeated,
but in trembling tones. For the moment despair
got the better of the determination in which he had
come to keep that appointment. He had cheated
before. A wave of emotion swept over him, and he
swayed for a moment from sheer physical weakness.
What difference did it make? he felt. He did not care.
A wild impulse seized him to tell the truth boldly.
He would tell everything, confess everything, but
about that one thing he would be believed. It was
the end, he knew; but he would not have the end come
and himself be involved, convicted, of what was not
true. There was enough that was. The master was
looking at him coldly, but for the moment was saying
nothing. Finch put his hand out to a near-by table
to steady himself.</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Mr. Roylston, a gleam of triumph
in his sharp black eyes, “I see that you do not mean to
dispute me.”</p>

<p>“Do you want the truth?” cried Finch, meeting
the master’s eye again with a fierce look.</p>

<p>“Naturally.”</p>

<p>“Then you shall have it!”</p>

<p>Finch threw back his head; he expanded in body
and soul; and kept his eyes fastened on Mr. Roylston’s
countenance in which he was to see a variety of
emotions depicted in the next few moments. He
felt his hour was come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>“You shall have it!” he repeated, moistening his
parched lips.</p>

<p>To Mr. Roylston’s fascinated gaze, the boy seemed
transformed; a soul, misshaped, distorted, hitherto
utterly abased, had risen in that despised body, and
was leaping forth from the boy’s eyes to grapple
with his own soul. He had a sickening sense that he
was about to pass through an unseemly scene, the
most unseemly and disagreeable scene of his life,
and that he was powerless to avert it.</p>

<p>“You shall have it,” repeated Finch again. “I
have cheated&mdash;cheated&mdash;cheated&mdash;day after day&mdash;day
after day. And I’ll tell you why. Because, slave
as I would, work as I could for you, I never got one
mark of credit, one word of praise, one syllable of
recognition from your cold hateful mouth. I tried
like a dog to do my best for you&mdash;it was poor, but it
was my best! but it was no use. From the day I
got to this place you have hated and despised me.
Oh, I have seen it, and knew it, and cursed you,
cursed you for it. You wouldn’t let yourself be fair.
Do you know, I’ve lived in hell in this school. And
at last, I determined to cheat you, to pay you back
in the only dirty way I knew how. But to-day, something&mdash;I
don’t know what&mdash;it wasn’t fear of you&mdash;<i>something</i>
made me honest. The paper you took from
me I had written out from memory after I got into
the room.”</p>

<p>“Stick to facts,” said the master.</p>

<p>“I am sticking to facts. Believe it or not&mdash;it’s
true. That’s true, though I who tell it am a cheat
and a liar and a sneak. I have been all that&mdash;not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
because I was made that way or wanted to be, I
don’t think, but because I couldn’t get a chance to
be myself, couldn’t get a show. And you&mdash;you kept
me from being decent as much as anybody else, as
much as the biggest bully in the school. You want me
to stick to facts. All right, I’ll stick to ‘em. I have
hated you. I have hated you so that many a time I’ve
wanted to kill you. And because I couldn’t think
of any way to fight you in the open, I have been low
and vile, and fought you in the dark. You thought
Kit Wilson rough-housed your rooms last year,
didn’t you? That’s the way you suspect people without
evidence, and act on your suspicions and can’t
hide ‘em when you don’t dare to act. I hate Wilson
too, so I was glad when you thought he was the guilty
one. But I did it, I tell you. I rough-housed your
rooms and hid your papers and messed up your desk
drawers and books. I couldn’t stand it. I can’t
stand it any longer. You’ll have me fired, I know
that&mdash;and I don’t care. But for once in your life you
are hearing what is thought of you. You’re hated,
hated, hated!”</p>

<p>The boy paused for a moment, out of breath, still
clutching the table desperately. Mr. Roylston tried
but could not speak. A thousand emotions stung him
to the quick; and deep within, there was a sense, outrageous
as was this attack, that he was at the bar of
an avenging justice, paying with bitter humiliation for
the lack of charity of which the boy’s wild words convicted
him. At last he found his voice, but he was
still under the spell of the strange situation.</p>

<p>“I will tolerate this extraordinary conversation a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
moment longer. Why have you so viciously hated
me?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;because you are cruel,” cried Finch, recovering
himself, “because you are pitiless, because
you do wicked, unkind things in the name of justice.
Yes, yes, you shall have it all. You have
never given me one chance, and you were glad&mdash;<i>glad</i>
to-day when you thought you had caught me at last.
You are always suspecting, suspecting evil&mdash;until
at last your suspicions find it or create it. You have
scared me, hurt me, hounded me&mdash;I don’t know how
you do it, but you do do it&mdash;and, thank God, you’ll
never do it again. Of course, you’ll have me fired now,
I know that, and I don’t care. And I deserve to be.
I ain’t fit to be here. But it’s you as much as anyone
else that’s kept me from being fit. I am just
full of hate and malice. Don’t I know it? Don’t
I suffer from it?”</p>

<p>“Aside from my severity&mdash;or my cruelty, as you
are pleased to call it,&mdash;for what else do you blame
me?”</p>

<p>“Above all,” cried Finch, and a note of exultation
rang in his voice, “above all for the way you’ve treated
Anthony Deering. I know him, and he is the soul of
honor, he has a heart. You or I aren’t fit to unlace
his boots. You kept him from getting what he deserved&mdash;the
Head Prefectship.”</p>

<p>“Deering told you that?”</p>

<p>“No, Deering didn’t tell me that. Deering’s not
that sort, don’t you know it, can’t you believe it?
He isn’t a sneak; but I am; and I listened under the
windows of the faculty room the night you spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
against him, the first night of this year. And what had
he done against you except what half the fellows do
to most of the masters more or less all the time?
But you wouldn’t forgive him, though he was fool
enough to be sorry for what he had done, for making
fun of you. But you couldn’t be kind. I listened&mdash;I
heard it all. You saved that paper, and bided your
time, that’s what you did&mdash;waited your chance to get
even. Do you know that many a night I’ve laid in
bed and prayed for courage to get up and come over
and do some terrible thing to you. I’ve actually
wanted to kill you. But I don’t want to now. The
bitterest medicine you can take is to have, for once
in your life, some one else, though it’s only a worthless
rotten chap like me, tell you to your face that you are
cruel and unkind and that he despises you.”</p>

<p>At last Finch stopped. He was trembling violently,
his cheeks were blazing, his eyes feverish and wild,
but his soul was filled with a sense of triumph.</p>

<p>For a moment Mr. Roylston covered his face with
his hand. Then he rose up quickly, master of himself
again.</p>

<p>“You are excited and irresponsible.”</p>

<p>“I’m excited,” said Finch, “but I know perfectly
well what I’m saying.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Mr. Roylston, “if you are not
suddenly gone insane, you must leave this school at
once. You will come with me instantly to Doctor
Forester.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m ready to be fired.”</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston made no reply, but opened the study
door, and motioned to the boy to follow him. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
left Howard House and walked rapidly across the
quadrangle to the Rectory. It was a warm humid
night, after a week of intense cold. There was a pale
young moon in the western sky.</p>

<p>As they reached the foot of the Rectory steps,
Finch turned. “I’m not going in,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, you are, and at once.”</p>

<p>“I’m not. This is the end. I am done with it.
I’m going to chuck it all. Say what you please, the
time for browbeating, scaring me is gone. I’m
off.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” cried the master in
alarm.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter. You will never see me again.”
With that he turned, and ran rapidly across the campus
down the hill.</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston strained his eyes for a moment after
the fleeing figure, then ran hastily up the steps, and
knocked at the door of the Doctor’s study.</p>

<p>Doctor Forester himself opened the door, and drew
the agitated master within. Deering, Lawrence and
Clavering were sitting before the study fire. They
had risen and were standing.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked the Head quickly.</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston forgot the boys’ presence. “A serious
thing&mdash;a very serious thing. Finch, just now, in my
study, attacked me with the most wanton, intemperate
abuse. I brought him to you&mdash;but here&mdash;at the very
door he turned and fled....”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;fled&mdash;why&mdash;where?”</p>

<p>“It is very serious, I think. I think it would be
better if these boys went after him at once. I fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
something terrible may happen. I will explain later.”
He sank exhausted into a chair.</p>

<p>“Which way has he gone, sir?” asked Tony.</p>

<p>“Across the campus&mdash;down the hill. Hurry, Deering,
hurry! else something terrible may happen.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="pch">SELF-SACRIFICE</p>

<p>It was a warm muggy night. A pale moon shone
dimly through the mists, and the buildings of the
school cast long shadows across the campus, giving
a weird uncanny effect to the scene, of which the boys
were immediately conscious as they came out of the
Doctor’s study.</p>

<p>They waited for a moment outside, straining their
eyes for a sight of Finch. Suddenly Jimmie discerned
a dark figure just disappearing over the brow of the
hill. “There he goes,” he cried, “over the hills towards
the beach.”</p>

<p>“All right&mdash;after him!” urged Tony, and set the
pace at a rapid trot. Lawrence and Clavering kept
close behind.</p>

<p>In a few moments they had reached the brow of the
hill over which Lawrence had seen the figure disappear.
They paused for a moment to look about them.
Out of range of the lights of the school, the mists
were less confusing and the moonlight more effective.
Tony was searching the beach with his eyes. “I
can’t make out a thing,” he said. “Do you see anything
of him, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing,” Clavering answered. “Are you
sure, Jim, you saw him a moment ago?”</p>

<p>“Dead sure. Look there! isn’t that him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Down by the road&mdash;near the marshes.” He
pointed eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” cried Tony. “Come on. He’s no
good at running. We ought to catch him before he
reaches the Pond. If he gets to the Woods, there’s
no knowing where to find him.”</p>

<p>They started down the hill at a rapid pace.</p>

<p>“He would have to go round the Pond to get into
the Woods,” said Clavering as they ran. “The ice
is rotten; he can’t cross the Pond. So let’s go to the
north and cut him off.”</p>

<p>“You do that, Ned,” suggested Tony. “Cut in
at the farmhouse by the head of the Pond; Jim and
I will keep right on. He may never stop to think that
the ice has gone rotten.”</p>

<p>“All right. Look, he’s slowing up.” They could
see with fair distinctness.</p>

<p>Finch, for it was he, had reached the foot of the hill.
He paused for a moment, seeming to hesitate between
the Old Beach Road and the path across the marshes;
and apparently chose the latter, for he crossed the road,
and climbed the stone wall. Ignorant that he was so
closely followed, he had not been running very fast, so
that our friends were rapidly gaining upon him. By the
time they had reached the foot of the hill, he was only
halfway across the marshes; and was forced to pick his
way, for he was not very familiar with the ground, and
was handicapped by his frequent stumbling against a
stone. In some places the ground was hard and frozen,
in others it was wet and muddy.</p>

<p>“Cut across now to the head of the Pond,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Tony, as the three clambered over the stone wall
which divided the marshes from the road. “We can
catch him all right.”</p>

<p>Clavering diverged, as Deering suggested, and the
other two kept on directly in Finch’s track. It was
difficult to run over the uneven ground, and once
Jimmie tripped and fell over a boulder, so that they
were delayed for a moment. The marshes were about
two hundred yards wide, and ended at the high bank
which had been built up around Beaver Pond, which
was used as a reservoir. Beyond loomed the dark
ridges of Lovel’s Woods, ghostly in the pale misty
moonlight.</p>

<p>As Finch emerged at last from the uneven, reed-choked
ground of the marshes, Tony and Jimmie
were scarcely fifty yards behind him. Suddenly he
heard the sound of their pattering feet, and turned
and stood still like a startled deer to listen. Then,
as he made out the dark forms so little behind him,
he ran rapidly up the steep bank of the Pond.</p>

<p>“Jake, Jake, wait for me!” Tony called. “It’s
Deering&mdash;wait a second!”</p>

<p>Finch now on the top of the bank, stopped again.
Our two friends out of breath, paused at the bottom.
Hardly a dozen yards divided them.</p>

<p>“Wait a second! What’s your hurry?” Tony
repeated, starting forward again, but at that very
moment his foot caught in a loose stone and he went
sprawling, and Jimmie, too late to turn aside, fell
on top of him. Finch did not move, but waited a
moment, while the two picked themselves up. No
damage was done, but they were windless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who are you?” Finch called down.</p>

<p>“It’s me&mdash;Tony Deering.”</p>

<p>Again they started to climb the bank. Finch stooped
quickly and picked up a couple of enormous stones.</p>

<p>“Stop there!” he cried. “If you come up that bank,
I’ll fire this at your head. I mean it.”</p>

<p>The two pursuers stopped involuntarily.</p>

<p>“Throw that rock down. What’s the matter
with you?” cried Tony sharply.</p>

<p>“It don’t make any difference. What are you
following me for? What do you want with me?”</p>

<p>“I want to know what on earth you are cutting
out for like this. What’s the matter? we’re not going
to hurt you.”</p>

<p>“No, I know you’re not. Mind&mdash;don’t take a
step, or I’ll fire this at your head. I’ve chucked
the whole thing. I’m clearing out, d’ye hear? I
won’t be stopped.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Jake; you’re crazy. Don’t act like&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Maybe I am, but that don’t alter the fact that
you are not coming up that bank without getting
this in your head. I won’t be followed.”</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake, Jake, listen to reason.” Tony
began to advance cautiously.</p>

<p>“Back!” cried Finch. “Get back, if you’ve anything
to say.” And he poised the rock threateningly.</p>

<p>Tony stopped a moment, willing to accomplish
by persuasion what he was determined to effect by
force if need be. “All right,” he agreed. “We’ll
cry a truce for a minute. Don’t be an ass, now&mdash;tell
me what’s the trouble and where you are cutting
out to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who sent you after me?” demanded Finch.</p>

<p>“Mr. Roylston came&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pah!” Jake uttered an exclamation of profound
disgust.</p>

<p>“Mr. Roylston,” Tony repeated, “burst into
Doctor Forester’s study, and said that you had been
abusing him, and that you had lit out some place,
and then he came near falling into a faint. So we
started after you. This is no way to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care whether it’s a way or not,”
interrupted Finch. “I’m done with the school. I’m
chucking it.”</p>

<p>“Well, for goodness’ sake, don’t do it in a fool way
like this. Come back and take your medicine like a
man.”</p>

<p>“I’m tired of taking medicine,” Finch replied
bitterly. “I’ve taken all I ever mean to in that
school, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“That’s my affair.”</p>

<p>“Well, come back, and you can go off decently
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I’d back down to-morrow like the shivering
scared fool I’ve always been. To-night, I’m up to it.
I’m going now&mdash;to-night.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I dunno&mdash;it don’t make any difference&mdash;away
from here.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Jake; that’s a pretty mean way to
treat me&mdash;to say nothing of the school.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry if you feel that way. But I don’t
owe the school anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, you do, a lot; the Doctor&mdash;Bill&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Back!” cried Finch sharply. “Don’t try to sneak
up on me. Let me alone. Maybe I’ll write and let
you know where I am. But I am going to cut out
to-night.”</p>

<p>Tony glanced at Jimmie who was close by his side.
“Let’s risk it, Jim,” he whispered, “he can only hit
one of us, I reckon.” “All right&mdash;heave ahead!”
Jimmie responded in a low tone.</p>

<p>Without wasting further words the two boys began
to dash up the steep bank.</p>

<p>“Get down there!” Finch yelled. “I’m going to
throw.” He raised his arm, but something paralyzed
his vicious intention. It seemed to him that he tried
to throw and could not. The big stone fell crashing
from his hand, and rolled harmlessly down the bank.
Finch turned, and with a cry sprang toward the icy
surface of the Pond. When the boys got to the top
of the bank, he was already a dozen feet out on the
Pond.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, Jake, don’t try to cross the Pond.
The ice is rotten.” Tony and Jimmie were now at
the edge of the shore. “The ice is rotten.” Deering
repeated, “it can’t hold you.”</p>

<p>“I’m all right enough, I guess,” Finch called back.
“I’m light enough. So long!”</p>

<p>The two boys stood breathless, watching the retreating
figure.</p>

<p>“What’ll we do,” exclaimed Jimmie, turning a
ghastly face to his friend. “It won’t hold him.”</p>

<p>“No, I know it won’t.... Jake! Jake!” Tony
called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no reply. “Quick!” exclaimed Deering,
“get those planks there&mdash;we’ll run ‘em along the ice,
and have something to hold to if we go in. We’ve
got to follow. Quick, Jim!”</p>

<p>They dashed to a point a few yards up the shore
where some heavy planks had been placed by the
skaters early in the season to serve as seats in putting
on and taking off their skates. It was the work of a
second to rip up two of them, and slide them out on
the ice in the direction Finch had gone.</p>

<p>By this time the runaway boy was about twenty
yards from shore, he had stopped for the moment and
was watching them curiously. When he saw them
slide the planks out, he started again, heading for the
opposite bank from which the dark woods loomed up.
They could see him distinctly, trying to slide, his
foot catching every second in the soft ice.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a cry. “There he goes!”
cried Jimmie, as Finch disappeared beneath the ice.</p>

<p>They pushed breathlessly, incautiously forward,
sending the planks on ahead of them. Finch rose
in the middle of the great hole that his plunge had
made. They could hear him sputter and see him splash
helpless in the pool of dark water and broken bits of
rotten ice. He could swim, and had got to the edge
of the circle of water, and was clutching desperately
at the firmer ice. But each time it gave way, enlarging
the hole, but bringing the boy very little nearer his
would-be rescuers.</p>

<p>“Stick to it, Jake!” Tony called. “We’ll get you
out, if you can hold out. Quick, Jim. Slide the
plank out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>On they went, fearful every instant that they would
be in like predicament. “There’s no use,” said
Jimmie. “If we only had a rope!”</p>

<p>“Well, we haven’t, and he can’t hold out till we
get one.”</p>

<p>At that very second Finch lost his hold again and
for the second time slipped beneath the icy waters
of the Pond. He came up in a moment, splashing
again. “Help, help!” he called despairingly.</p>

<p>“All right&mdash;hold out&mdash;we’re coming.” They had
got the plank well out now toward the struggling boy.
“Hold out, Jake&mdash;We’ll get it to you.”</p>

<p>Inch by inch they got it nearer. But Finch was
becoming exhausted.</p>

<p>“He can’t do it!” cried Jimmie. “Oh, God help
us! What shall we do? What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Tony. “I am going in after
him if he goes down again. Keep the plank out and
I can get hold of it, and hang on, maybe, till you get
back with help. Yell for Ned to stay and help here,
if he can. Then run to the farmhouse and get a rope.
And for God’s sake, go quick, Jim.”</p>

<p>“Tony! don’t&mdash;you can’t!”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to. Hold on, Jake,” he cried again. The
end of the plank was at the edge of the hole. Finch
clutched at it, but his strength was gone. “I can’t,”
he cried feebly, and sank again.</p>

<p>“Do as I told you, now,” said Tony. He ripped
off his coat and shoes and was sliding forward. As he
neared the hole, suddenly the ice crushed beneath
his weight, and he sank into the bitter depths. In a
second he was at the surface, and striking out boldly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
to the spot where Finch had gone down. He dived
once, got hold of Finch’s body, clasped it, and with
terrible effort got to the surface again. Jimmie had
pushed the plank almost within his reach. He clasped
it tightly, and managed by its aid to keep his own
and Finch’s head above water. Finch seemed lifeless.
“A rope, a rope,” called Tony.</p>

<p>Lawrence was already crawling back to the shore,
where Clavering, who had heard the commotion, had
run down to meet him.</p>

<p>“Finch fell in&mdash;Tony’s gone in after him, and he’s
got him, and’s clinging to a plank. Do what you can.
I’m off for a rope at the Red Farmhouse.”</p>

<p>Clavering took in the situation at a glance. And
as Lawrence began to start across the marsh, he
began to haul a heavier plank out on the ice, calling
out encouragement to Tony as he did so.</p>

<p>Jimmie ran like the wind, and at last reached the
farmhouse on the edge of the marshes. “A rope, a
rope,” he cried, to the astonished farmer into whose
kitchen he had burst. “There’s two boys drowning
in the Pond.”</p>

<p>In ten minutes Jimmie, the farmer and his son,
were back at the edge of the Pond, with a stout rope
which had a noose at the end. “Hurry up!” called
Clavering, “he’s holding out.”</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="i292" id="i292">i292</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>In a moment they were out on the ice and had
thrown the noosed rope to Tony, clinging for dear
life to the plank. He managed to get it about his
shoulders, then the four, the two boys on the ice, and
the farmer and his son on the shore, began to pull.
It was a struggle, but at last their efforts proved
successful and Tony, half-dead with the cold and
almost paralyzed from the burden of Finch’s lifeless
body, was hauled out on firm ice, and then carried
to the shore. There the farmer’s wife had arrived
with blankets and whisky. They swathed the two
half-drowned boys in the blankets; the farmer and his
son picked up Finch, whom they thought was dead;
Lawrence and Clavering did the same for Deering,
and in a few moments they were at the Red Farm.
Mrs. Simpson, the farmer’s wife, had already telephoned
for a doctor and to the School.</p>

<p>Soon Doctor Carter, the school physician, and
Doctor Forester himself, arrived on the scene. They
gave directions for Tony to be well wrapped in blankets
and to be taken at once to the school infirmary, and
then set to work in the effort to restore Finch to
consciousness.</p>

<p>Jimmie drove up to the Infirmary in the farmer’s
wagon with Tony, and helped the nurses get him to
bed. Then for two hours he waited for the news from
the farmhouse. It was after eleven when at last a
ring came on the telephone. Jimmie sprang to the
receiver. It was Doctor Forester, wanting the head
nurse. “Finch is just living,” he said. “We will
bring him up later. Tell the nurse I wish to speak to
her.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE CHAPEL</p>

<p>On the morrow the school learned the thrilling story
of the night. The boys were filled with wonder at the
heroism, only to be cast into the depths of anxiety by
the news from the Infirmary. Finch, though living, was
in a high fever and delirious; doomed, if he ultimately
recovered, the physician said, to do so only after a
severe illness. Deering was threatened with pneumonia.
For nearly a week the issues were not certain.
Then at last came the welcome announcement that
Tony was out of danger and by another week would
be about. Finch’s malady had developed into brain
fever. It would be weeks before a crisis was reached;
months before recovery could be hoped for.</p>

<p>Clavering and Lawrence told the story of the rescue,
and left nothing to the imagination in their assertion
and account of Tony’s heroism. In the excitement
with which the boys listened to the tale and with which
they waited for Tony’s reappearance that they might
give him a splendid ovation, it was practically forgotten&mdash;and
indeed few knew&mdash;why Finch had started
across the Pond that night. The scene in the Rectory
study when Mr. Roylston had appeared, was kept
a strict secret, owing to the Head Master’s explicit
injunctions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>One night, shortly after the episode, the first night
that any favorable news had come from the Infirmary,
as Doctor Forester was sitting before his study fire,
there came a tap on the door, and in response to his
summons, Mr. Roylston entered.</p>

<p>“Ah, I am glad to see you,” said the Head, who
had been waiting, a little impatiently, for his assistant
master to seek this interview. “Have a cigar?”
he added.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” said Mr. Roylston, seating himself
in a straight-backed chair. “I have come&mdash;as soon
as I could recover from the shock of recent events&mdash;to
tell you what I know&mdash;what led me several nights
ago, to bring Finch here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said the Doctor, “I want to hear all
about it. I have foreborne to question you, though
I realized there was something behind it which in
good time you would explain. Fortunately now, we
are assured that Deering is out of danger. The doctor
holds out some small hope for poor Finch, but it
will be a tough pull.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I fear so. I hope, I hope deeply that he will
recover. I am relieved to know that Deering is better.”
He paused for a moment, as though he could scarcely
bring himself to say what was on his mind. “Doctor
Forester, I have come to-night not only to give you
an explanation but to make a confession.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Head in a sympathetic tone.</p>

<p>“I have always tried, sir, to do my duty in this
school according to my light.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Doctor Forester, “I believe that, my
friend.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>“But my light, sir, has often,&mdash;always, I fear,
been a poor one.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” interposed the older man, “who of us would
dare say otherwise? We all fall short, every one.”</p>

<p>“Possibly&mdash;but all are not too proud, as I have been,
to acknowledge it. I have never acknowledged it,
sir, until to-night&mdash;not even to myself.” He paused
again, to continue presently, as he shaded his face
with his hand, “I will not go into details, but I
want to put it boldly, baldly. I have been hard, hard
to the degree of cruelty, on that poor boy who is
lying now in the delirium of a dangerous fever. God
forgive me!... I disapproved, sir, of your taking
him here, and though, even now, I cannot say that I
think you were wise in that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Alas, no!” interrupted the Head Master, “not
if we are to judge by the immediate results. But I
think I see deeper....”</p>

<p>The master thought a moment in silence. “Yes,”
he said at last. “I think you do. It is having a wider,
a deeper effect than I have realized.... But he,
poor boy, has suffered, and I have so often, so uncharitably,
made him suffer; while those, whom I
have not liked, Morris, young Deering, and others,
have been kind. It is terrible to me, sir, now to think
of that suffering.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my friend, yes; I think it must be. You have
been hard, too hard; but, thank God, righteousness
comes of suffering. I can see, oh, in so many ways,
how poor Finch’s suffering is teaching us all a lesson,
teaching us a truer religion, a sweeter, kinder philosophy
of life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>“As I said,” Mr. Roylston resumed, “I was hard
on him, hard on Deering, whom poor Finch worshiped
with passionate adoration. And I accused Finch of
cheating&mdash;he had not sometimes been strictly honest&mdash;but
on that occasion, I misjudged him&mdash;wounded
him deeply&mdash;he may have resisted a keen temptation.
At any rate, worn-out, half-crazed, quite desperate,
he came to me that night and made a passionate
attack on me. His language was ill-tempered, ill-judged,
violent!&mdash;but the awful part of it to me is,
that in substance his accusations were justified. I
had been, as he told me, so terribly cruel, hard, mean.
I could not end the scene, unseemly as it was; for my
conscience was accusing me more bitterly, more
deeply, more violently than that poor half-crazed
lad.... At last, scarcely knowing what to do, I
sought to bring him to you.... At the very door
of this room, he turned and fled. I feared he meant,
as he had practically threatened, to destroy himself.
And but for Deering how nearly he succeeded!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said the Head Master gently, “I see,
I see....”</p>

<p>“And I have,” continued Mr. Roylston, “I have
too been hard on Deering&mdash;have not acknowledged
in him the qualities&mdash;manliness, honor, unselfishness&mdash;which
I have known were there. He gladly sprang
to the chance of laying down his life for the poor little
abandoned wretch for whom I could not find a kind
word. God forgive me, Doctor, I cannot forgive
myself.”</p>

<p>“God does forgive you, my friend,” said the Head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
without looking up. He had been gazing into the fire,
thinking deeply.</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston did not reply to this remark, and for a
few moments both men sat in silence, staring into the
fire, absorbed in their thoughts.</p>

<p>It was Doctor Forester at last who spoke again.
“It would be easy, my friend, to assure you that you
exaggerate, that you do yourself injustice; and, in
truth, I think you do. But I have no wish to urge
that view upon you; for I believe, to be quite frank,
that there is a poor weaker side to all of us that we
never have a chance of conquering altogether unless
we recognize it, and if for a long time we have not
recognized it or have deceived ourselves, nothing is so
good for us as a frank confession. As for the details
of the incidents to which you refer, of course I am in
ignorance, and I prefer to be. So far as I have observed
your treatment toward Finch, it merited no criticism;
and as for your attitude toward Deering, I have
nothing to say that I did not say the night we discussed
his appointment to the Head Prefectship.
I thought you severe but not unjust. As a matter
of fact, if you feel now that you could wish you had
taken another course, I may tell you that I do not
think the fact that Deering is not Head Prefect has
in the least interfered with his popularity or his influence
with the boys. Clavering has made him his
right hand man.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of that,” said Mr. Roylston.</p>

<p>“And now, after this rescue of Finch at the risk
of his own life,&mdash;undoubtedly he will be the strongest
boy in school.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think that I should like to tell him that I do
fully forgive him&mdash;that I regret my stand with regard
to his appointment.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Head Master, “I think that he
would like to hear.”</p>

<p>With that Mr. Roylston said good-night. He
walked over to the Infirmary at once and enquired
about the two boys. Finch’s condition was still unsatisfactory,
but Deering was very much better&mdash;and,
yes, he was quite able to see Mr. Roylston if
the master desired.</p>

<p>Tony was still in bed, but he looked splendidly
well and bright as he lay in the cool white cot, which
had been pushed near the open log fire. A nurse had
been reading to him. He had had a close call, but now
he was practically himself again and would be going
down in a few days.</p>

<p>He was surprised to see Mr. Roylston, but not in
the least embarrassed. He shook hands cordially.
The master enquired about his health, made some
perfunctory remarks about the rescue and about
the school, fidgeting and ill at ease, until the nurse
took the hint and slipped away.</p>

<p>“I came,” he said then, as he drew up the chair
near the bedside and took a seat, “not only to enquire
about you, as I have been doing daily, but to have a
little talk with you, since I know you are practically
all right again.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Tony.</p>

<p>“Do you know, Anthony,” asked Mr. Roylston
suddenly, “why it was that Jacob Finch tried to run
away that night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, no, sir&mdash;I don’t&mdash;not altogether, that is.
Poor Jake was in a bad way; things had been getting
pretty hard for him for one reason or another, and he
was making them still harder for himself. I did hear
that you caught him cheating in your Latin examination,
and I just supposed that that was the last straw.
He’s always been rather friendly with me, but he was
so vicious that night down by the pond, refusing
altogether to tell me why he was cutting out, that I
thought him a little out of his head. But I supposed
the cheating was really responsible.”</p>

<p>“Well,” rejoined Mr. Roylston, after a moment’s
reflection, “as a matter of fact I was altogether mistaken
about his cheating in that particular examination.
I believe what he afterwards told me, that he
had not cheated at all; though, as he also acknowledged
he had cheated so often before that I can hardly
blame myself for suspecting him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said Tony; “I am afraid poor Jake
lost all hold of himself. He was not naturally a cheat
or a story-teller, but&mdash;but&mdash;well, I try to think he
wasn’t altogether responsible.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not&mdash;that night in my room, at all events,
he quite lost control of himself as a result of my
accusation, and he told me in a very bitter language
that my attitude toward him had been one of the
chief causes of his unhappiness here at Deal.”</p>

<p>Tony scarcely knew what to say to this, for of course
he remembered how bitterly Finch had always hated
Mr. Roylston. The master, however, did not expect
a reply. “I think,” he went on, “that there was a
good deal of justice in what the boy said, though I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
not mean to go into that with you to-night. Among
other things he told me that night that he intensely
resented my attitude toward you.”</p>

<p>Tony laughed a little. “Jake showed equally bad
judgment whether he greatly liked or disliked a person.”</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Mr. Roylston, “right or wrong,
his remarks have caused me to think things over very
seriously the last few days, and I have come to the
conclusion that in this also Finch was right. I was
hard on you&mdash;too hard.”</p>

<p>Tony lay still for a moment, thinking; finally he
raised himself a little and looked at the master intently.
“Mr. Roylston,” he said, “it’s mighty white
of you to come and say this to me. In return I want
to tell you just one thing&mdash;the one thing I have
against you&mdash;the rest has been give and take, and
none of it, it seems to me, very serious. I know I
have annoyed you a great many times and that
occasionally in Lower School days I was more or less
impertinent, but I did one thing that I was thoroughly
ashamed of and thoroughly sorry for. As for your
soaking me a lot in the old days, as for your preventing
me from being Head Prefect, I’ve borne no grudge.
I think you were pretty stiff&mdash;I think honestly you
are too stiff as to discipline most of the time&mdash;but I
never thought you were unfair or unjust, and I have
but one grudge against you. And that is that when
I apologized to you for writing that thing a year
ago you wouldn’t accept my apology really; you
wouldn’t believe I was sorry.”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe so now,” said Mr. Roylston,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
“and it is to tell you that particularly that I have
come here to-night.”</p>

<p>“I’m mighty glad, sir. That’s all I ever blamed you
for, sir,&mdash;really. I have often complained of you in a
noisy careless kind of way, as I have of other masters,
but that was all guff. I didn’t any more really mean
those things than I supposed you meant things when
you would look at us sometimes as if we were actually
beneath contempt.”</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston reflected a moment. “I am afraid,”
he continued, “that on my side, I do regret a great
many things. I have been genuinely lacking in sympathy
more than once. I have often been unnecessarily
hard. It has not been right; and, as you see, I
regret it. The more keenly, I fancy, as my lack of
sympathy in this particular case of Finch counted a
great deal in what so nearly meant a tragedy.”</p>

<p>“Well, fortunately, it wasn’t one, sir. The nurse
tells me that they think poor Jake will pull through.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he will not get back to work again this
term; there is no chance of that.”</p>

<p>“What do you think, sir, will happen to him?
what will he do next year?”</p>

<p>“Well, I am beginning to feel as I have never felt
before that after all this the situation will clear itself,
will be changed. I fancy he will stay on at Deal next
year, and I begin to think that we will know how
then to help him make good.”</p>

<p>“Really?&mdash;well, I wish he could. I’d feel pretty
good to know that poor Jake had made good here.
I’m afraid I haven’t helped him very much.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t helped him very much!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Mr. Roylston. “Though what you have done for him
may seem not to have counted just now, I feel very
certain that it will appear to count tremendously
later.”</p>

<p>“Why, sir&mdash;I really didn’t do anything.”</p>

<p>Mr. Roylston smiled. “Well, I must not talk with
you any longer. Good-night, Anthony. I hope you
will get down very soon, and I trust that in the
future we will understand one another a little better.”</p>

<p>“I am sure we will, sir. And thank you ever so
much for coming up.”</p>

<p>“I fancy,” Mr. Roylston murmured to himself,
as he left the room, “I fancy that hereafter I shall
understand all boys a little better.”</p>

<p>On the Sunday of the week that Tony was in the
Infirmary, the Doctor took the opportunity to make
some remarks about the boy’s act of heroism in the
course of his sermon in the Chapel.</p>

<p>“Fortunately,” he said, “one of the boys about
whom we have been so anxious the past few days is
now quite out of danger and will soon be amongst
us once more, and though the other must still undergo
a long and severe illness the physicians hold out strong
hope of his ultimate recovery.</p>

<p>“Naturally,” he continued, “such a dramatic
incident as the rescue of one boy by another at the
risk of his life has brought vividly before our minds
the characters of the two boys principally involved,
their situation and relation to the school. One of
these boys as we know has had the advantages of a
normal, happy, healthy boyhood, the other through
misfortune has been deprived of almost all that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
first boy has enjoyed. But the self-forgetful service
of the one for the other, a service that culminated
in heroism when he freely risked his life to save the
other’s, has set us all an example of kindliness and
consideration, an example of true religion, of unselfish
Christian service, that we should take to
heart....</p>

<p>“There have been criticisms in connection with
this affair that Deal School is only adapted to dealing
with and caring for the happy, healthy, lucky type of
boy. I do not think so. Despite much that has been
unfortunate, despite much suffering that has been
involved and still may be involved, despite even the
lives that have been risked, it has been a thing tremendously
worth while to the school to have had that less
fortunate, less happy boy amongst us.</p>

<p>“It is a noble and a fine thing to risk one’s life to
save the life of another, and I do not doubt that most,
if not all, of our boys would gladly seize such an
opportunity in the same spirit as it was seized by
Anthony Deering and his companions a few nights
since. That gladness to risk life should be a symbol
of what is infinitely harder, and infinitely more needed,
I may say, but of which also our friends set us the
example,&mdash;the good will and unselfishness to live for
others. A school altogether fails, just as a human life
altogether fails, if at heart and in spirit, it is not dedicated,
so far as opportunity permits, to the service of
men. The lesson of this incident is the lesson that
I would we might all learn from the school.”</p>

<p>The Doctor’s sermon was not the kind of a sermon
to be much discussed, but it made a deep impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
on the school. For one or two masters and for several
boys it was the inspiration as they knelt later of as
earnest prayer as they had ever offered.</p>

<p>Doctor Forester had been going frequently to the
Infirmary to see Tony, and after the first few days
he had continued his confirmation instructions so
that Deering could keep up with the class.</p>

<p>Tony’s first appearance amongst the boys after
his convalescence was in the Chapel at the preparatory
service the night before the confirmation. It was
a quiet little service, conducted by the Bishop and
the Head. Again the theme of the address was
service&mdash;a theme that in some fashion or other seemed
to have flashed in and out of all Tony’s consciousness
and experience for the past year.</p>

<p>As he knelt that night in the dim Chapel and
offered up a grateful thanksgiving that life and health
had been spared to him, he resolved more definitely
and consciously than ever before that whatever he
did in the world thereafter he would never live wholly
or selfishly for himself.</p>

<p>And in after years he was to look back on that
night, as he looked back on the night on the beach
when he had walked with Mr. Morris, as another
important moment in the process of his coming to
himself.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE LAST TERM</p>

<p>It was a warm bright May day, with just enough
breeze to fleck the waves of the bay and passage
with white caps and make it lively for the school
crews in their heavy whaleboats, the substitute at
Deal for the conventional shell.</p>

<p>From their post on the Rocking-stone or just by
it, high up on the highest ridge of Lovel’s Woods,
two boys looked out upon the spreading panorama
of marsh and beach and river and bay. They both
were drinking it in with a deep sense of its beauty
and with a sense too that it was the more beautiful
in that it all was a part of the old school. Up on the
hill there, across the wide valley of the marshes and
Beaver Pond and Creek, rose the school itself, gleaming
now in the bright western sunlight as a fairy
castle of rose and gold.</p>

<p>One of the boys by the Rocking-stone was Tony
Deering, coatless, hatless, his hair glowing in the sunlight,
half-hidden by the tall sweet grass in which
he lay at full length. The other was Reginald Carroll,
now nearly at the end of his Freshman year at
Kingsbridge College, back at the School for a week-end
as he had so often been since his graduation the
previous June. Much of his time on these occasions,
though we have not chanced to note it, was spent
with Deering, much too with Mr. Morris between
whom and himself the old feeling of distrust had altogether
dropped away. For during his last term at
school Reggie had won his house-master’s confidence
as well as his regard.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="i306" id="i306">i306</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">“YOU WILL CERTAINLY BE COMING UP TO COLLEGE NEXT YEAR?”</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys were sprawled flat on their stomachs
in the warm sweet grass, heads on hands, at the very
edge of the ridge, peering off across the tops of the
pine trees and cedars that rose from the ravine between
the ridges almost to a level with their heads.
They looked eastward and their position commanded
a view of the Strathsey river, the harbor in the bend
of the Neck, the broad beach and bay, and the open
ocean beyond. They could see the House crews out
beyond Deigr Light; they were turning the noses of
their boats toward the harbor again in the hope of
getting back for supper. A dozen or more sailboats
were in the river. Tony and Reggie had been
sailing, and had stopped at the Rocking-stone on their
way back to the School.</p>

<p>“Peachy day, Reg, isn’t it?” said Tony, for the
thousandth time sniffing of the good sea breeze.</p>

<p>“Well, rather,” drawled Reggie for reply. He
was still languid, individual, different, but distinctly
more purposeful, less afflicted with the air of being
perpetually bored than when we first observed him
some four or five years ago.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it make you sort of sicky to feel you
can’t have it all the time?”</p>

<p>“It does, boy; as you yourself before long will be
finding out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah&mdash;I know.”</p>

<p>“But, I tell you what, Tony; it makes it almost
worth while being away, it is so wonderful to come
back. College is different, likable too; but it never
takes the place of school. Though I must say, toward
the end of the year I begin to feel myself caring for
it as I didn’t in the least think I should. It’s rough at
first, as I told you before, as you could see from my
pretending it wasn’t last fall. But here&mdash;well, the
heart’s at home here.”</p>

<p>Tony smiled his appreciation of the phrase. “Old
chap, you do get your sentiments expressed now and
then in perfectly good nice poetry, don’t you? I feel
like that ever so often, but to save my life I can never
find words that seem in the least to do justice to my
thoughts.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, that comes a good deal not only from
feeling a thing, boy; but quite as much from the habit
of hunting for the right phrase now and then, as old
Jack used to tell us in Sixth English.”</p>

<p>Tony drew in the fragrance of the May flowers that
a fresh breeze stirred. “Bully, isn’t it? This always
was a favorite spot of yours, wasn’t it, Reg?”</p>

<p>“Rather&mdash;oh, the time I’ve wasted here, little one&mdash;scribbling
verse and stuff, dreaming dreams that
never came true!”</p>

<p>“You mooning here, poetizing&mdash;you must let me
see your latest, by the way,&mdash;always remind me of
those jolly verses in the Harrow Song Book&mdash;remember&mdash;‘Byron
lay, lazily lay’?”</p>

<p>“More or less&mdash;mostly less; let’s have it.”</p>

<p>Tony essayed it in his clear voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p class="ppq8 p1">“’Byron’ lay, lazily lay,<br />

<p class="p1">“That’s all; I don’t know the rest. But when we
sing it at General Singing or on the steps of the Old
School these spring nights, I always think of you,
and wonder if you scribble verses at Kingsbridge as
much as you used to at school.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, still,” laughed Reggie, “as much as ever&mdash;and
to as little purpose as ever, I fancy. But look here,
boy; I don’t like to suggest unpleasant things to you
such as the fact that school won’t last forever, but
I want to be sure of one thing&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“You will certainly be coming up to col. next
year?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, if I pass my exams. But of course
there’s not much doubt about that. I’m not in much
danger of being flunked.”</p>

<p>“Money matters all right?”</p>

<p>“So, so. Yes, much better, thank goodness. But
it’s going to be mighty hard to pull out of the old
school.”</p>

<p>“There is one thing that helps the pulling out a
lot, and particularly in your case,&mdash;” said Carroll,
“&mdash;more than it did in mine&mdash;such a lot of the
fellows go up to Kingsbridge from the School&mdash;quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the best of the form usually, it seems to me;
so that you feel quite at home there from the beginning.
Then there’s always a lot of Dealonians among the
upper classmen who look out for you more or less.
Most of your chums are going up, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;all, I think, except Ned Clavering. Too
bad&mdash;but Ned’s going to wear the blue&mdash;and I hope
we’ll line up against each other some time.”</p>

<p>“That’s hard luck; but I didn’t know Ned Clavering
was in your crowd.”</p>

<p>“Oh, our crowd!” exclaimed Tony, with something
like a sigh.</p>

<p>“What! do you mean to say that you and Kit
Wilson are still on the outs?”</p>

<p>“I’m ashamed to say, we are.”</p>

<p>“You still sore at Kit?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least!”</p>

<p>“Well, then, what’s the trouble?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the faintest idea. Sheer asininity on
both our parts, I reckon. I’ve started over to Kit’s
rooms a hundred times this term, I should say, and
turned back.”</p>

<p>“All serene with the rest of the crowd?”</p>

<p>“Oh, absolutely. After the Finch affair last term
everybody except Kit went out of their way to be
decent. Even Tack, whom I had been rather nasty
to.”</p>

<p>“Weren’t you a bit sore because Kit didn’t go out
of his way to be decent?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes&mdash;naturally; I suppose I was.”</p>

<p>“Well, listen to words of wisdom&mdash;it is all nonsense,
blooming idiotic nonsense. You quarreled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
about Finch. He’s gone. What’s become of that
little shaver, by the way?”</p>

<p>“Finch&mdash;oh, he is well now, I reckon; they have
taken him away&mdash;to the mountains or some place.
He is ever so much better in every way than before
he was ill&mdash;it seemed to need that tremendous break
and sickness to get him straight. I have an idea
that the Doctor,&mdash;good old chap, the Head!&mdash;will
keep him on here another year, and then put him to
work, without trying for college.”</p>

<p>“You carried the guardian angelship business
through, didn’t you? did it from the bottom up&mdash;as
I hoped you would.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I tried.... By Jove, Reg,” Tony exclaimed,
looking at his watch, “it’s nearly six; we’ll have to
wander if we want to get back in time for supper.
You are staying over, of course, for the game and
dance to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>That evening as the Sixth were singing on the
steps of the Old School, which was their custom on
warm spring nights, Carroll drew Kit Wilson out of
the crowd and walked him off under the shadows of
the trees.</p>

<p>“Look here, Wilson,” he said, “I’m butting into
something that isn’t in the least my affair, but I want
to know why on earth you and Tony Deering don’t
drop your differences and be friends?”</p>

<p>Kit swung himself loose from Reggie’s friendly
encircling arm. “Ask Deering,” he said laconically.</p>

<p>“I have asked Deering, and so far as he knows there
is no reason under heaven why you shouldn’t be as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
thick as you ever were. The original cause of your
misunderstanding has long since passed away. Deering
is simply holding off because you are. He doesn’t
know how you will take it if he makes advances.”</p>

<p>Still Kit kept silence.</p>

<p>“Come on, Wilson, don’t take it like that. I
haven’t any axe to grind; as a matter of fact in school
days, Deering’s intimacy with you meant that I see
a lot less of him, and I can tell you I didn’t relish that.
You like Tony, don’t you, really?”</p>

<p>“Like him!” cried Kit. “Doesn’t everybody like
him&mdash;even the odious Gumshoe? Like him! Why,
Carroll, I like him better than any fellow I ever
knew.”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear child&mdash;what then hinders you?”</p>

<p>“Does Tony care a hang about me?&mdash;has he ever
minded our not being friends?” asked Kit huskily.</p>

<p>“Has he minded? why, of course, he has minded.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never supposed he did; hasn’t he had
Jimmie and you and Bill Morris and a dozen others?
Why, honest, Reggie, even the Gumshoe just eats
out of his hand. It’s marvelous&mdash;don’t understand
it&mdash;or I guess I <i>do</i> understand it. You can’t <i>help</i> it,
can you?”</p>

<p>“No, you can’t; but note this;&mdash;the more Tony
cares for, the more it seems he can. And I tell you
what, Kit, with Tony or with anyone else, the loss of
one friend can never be made up by gaining others. If
you and Tony don’t make up, you will never forgive
yourselves later. As it is, you have lost nearly a
year of school life.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” said Kit miserably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, lose no more!”</p>

<p>As they drew back again within the range of the
singing, the Sixth were giving in fine form&mdash;“There’s
a wind that blows o’er the sea-girt isle,” a song that
Reggie had always particularly liked. He stepped
forward a bit to encore them. But Doc. Thorn, the
leader of the singing, catching sight of him, cried to
the fellows on the steps, “Let’s have ‘Old Boys’ now,
in honor of Reggie Carter Westover Carroll.”</p>

<p>And they rang it out with a hearty good will,
with long, lingering, caressing notes to the last lines,
notes that thrilled every Old Boy’s heart as he heard
the well-loved song.</p>

<p class="ppiq8 p1">“... and the heart is glad<br />
For all the friendliness of vanish’d years.”</p>

<p class="p1">The tears were in Reggie’s eyes. He was glad it was
dark, and that he could let them gather there without
fear of it being noticed. And just then Mr. Morris
stepped somewhere from out of the gloom and slipped
his arm around Reggie’s shoulders.</p>

<p>The singing was over then; the fellows were beginning
to separate for the evening and were calling to
each other as they started away from the steps.
Carroll pushed Wilson forward. “Now’s your chance,”
he whispered. “Don’t you be a fool and don’t let
Tony be a fool!”</p>

<p>Poor Kit’s heart was in his mouth; it seemed to
him to be thumping like a sledge-hammer. He had
a momentary wild hope that he would not be able to
find Tony. But yes,&mdash;there he was, just taking leave
of Ned Clavering and starting across the campus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
alone. Kit hurried after him, feeling as though his
legs would scarcely carry him another inch.</p>

<p>“I say&mdash;Tony!” he called at last, his voice husky
and strange.</p>

<p>Deering stopped, turned, but did not recognize
him. “What is it? Who’s calling?”</p>

<p>“It’s me&mdash;Kit. Wait a second, will you?”</p>

<p>Tony’s heart was beating wildly too, for he divined
what was coming; by the time Kit reached him his
hand was out.</p>

<p>“What’s your hurry?” cried Kit, grabbing the
extended hand and wringing it.</p>

<p>“I’m not in a hurry. Are you?”</p>

<p>“No, not a bit.” Then awkwardly, “Well, what
are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing&mdash;loaf&mdash;come and do it with me.”</p>

<p>“I’m your man. Where shall we go?”</p>

<p>“Good, old boy. To the beach then.”</p>

<p>They turned about, and arms went about each
other’s waist and neck. They swung off across the
fragrant fields, soft with the new mown grass, to the
beach. For a while they were silent.</p>

<p>“I have been a stubborn fool,” said Kit at last.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it; I’ve been a hot-headed one,”
protested Tony.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we’ve both been both,” said Kit
lucidly. “Any way, thank God it’s over.”</p>

<p>“Amen,” said Tony.</p>

<p>Another long silence as they strolled along, strangely
happy, in the fresh caressing night.</p>

<p>“I say, Kit.”</p>

<p>“Yes, old chap!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s you and Jim and me room together at college
next year.”</p>

<p>“Right o! I’ve hated to think of college next year
just on account of that&mdash;we used to plan to, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s all right now. Hard though it’s going
to be to leave the old school.”</p>

<p>“Mighty hard, Kit.”</p>

<p>Another silence; close step; shoulder to shoulder.</p>

<p>“I say, Tony.”</p>

<p>“Yes, old boy.”</p>

<p>“Let’s swear never to let this sort of thing happen
again. Let’s swear always to talk it out. No matter
what, never to break again.”</p>

<p>“All right&mdash;I swear&mdash;never to break again&mdash;absolutely&mdash;so
help me, God.”</p>

<p>“And I, I swear!&mdash;so help me, God.” They wrung
each other’s hands.</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;Tonio old sport,” said Kit after another
pause.</p>

<p>“What is it, Kitty?”</p>

<p>“Reg Carroll’s a brick, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“He certainly is. By the by, Kit, is Betty coming
down for the dance to-morrow night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, gets here to-morrow afternoon; Bab too.”</p>

<p>“Good work. Tell her, will you, before to-morrow
night that you and I have made it up.”</p>

<p>“I won’t need,” answered Kit; “I never let her
know we had fallen out.”</p>

<p>Tony gasped with astonishment. “Well, by Jove,
kiddo, you <i>are</i> a perfect corker.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>And so they strolled on, talking by fits and starts,
in the sweet fragrant May night, glad of heart, the
gladder that for long they had not known each other’s
friendship.</p>

<p>The next few weeks were wonderful ones to Tony
and his friends. On that bright Saturday a worthy
rival had come from western Cæsarea to meet their
baseball team and had bit the dust. Jimmie Lawrence,
captain of the team now, had played first without an
error and had knocked a home-run, bringing in three
men&mdash;a pleasant augury for the Boxford game in mid-June.
In the evening there had been the dance in
the Gymnasium, and Betty Wilson had been there,
lovelier than ever it seemed to Tony, as his eyes
fluttered in the light of her eyes and he thrilled with
a strange, nice, happy little thrill at the touch of her
hand in his. And Barbara Worthington was there,
and Kit too was beaming. As yet the shadow of the
final good-byes had not fallen upon them. There were
still three golden weeks for the reunited crowd.</p>

<p class="ptb1"><b>*********</b></p>

<p>One night, not long after the dance, Tony sat late
in Mr. Morris’s study, as he was apt to do these last
weeks, talking things over with his older friend.</p>

<p>“This has certainly been a bully term,” said Tony,
with a contented sigh, “I don’t think I have ever
been so happy. I can’t bear to think of leaving.”</p>

<p>Morris had been happy too, but for him the shadow
was already falling. “Ah&mdash;that’s the hard part of
school life&mdash;the going and the being left behind....
But you will be coming back often&mdash;that’s a comfort.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
I never cease to be thankful that Kingsbridge is so
near.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I shall be coming back mighty often. Doesn’t
seem really as if the school could run without us.
I suppose I shall like college, but I can’t imagine that
it will ever be quite the same as school.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Morris, as his mind turned back to
good Kingsbridge days, “one grows fond of it. But
school&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It’s as Reggie says,” Tony interrupted, “the heart’s
at home here. It will be bully to have Reggie and Kit
and Jim and so many of the old form at Kingsbridge,
but, magister, I shan’t have you.”</p>

<p>Morris’s heart glowed at this. “Stupid they,”
thought he, “who say a boy does not show feeling
or gratitude!” Aloud he murmured, “No; you will
not have me. But I will tell you what reconciles me
to the situation, Tony,&mdash;you will be coming back
during college days pretty often; and then&mdash;I have
a strong prophetic feeling&mdash;you will be coming back
for good.”</p>

<p>Tony smiled. “I wouldn’t wonder, you know.
I’ve often thought I’d like to. The heart’s at home
here, magister. Good-night.”</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of

remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
